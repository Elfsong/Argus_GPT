0,"dr. goldberg offers everything i look for in a general practitioner.  he's nice and easy to talk to without being patronizing; he's always on time in seeing his patients; he's affiliated with a top-notch hospital (nyu) which my parents have explained to me is very important in case something happens and you need surgery; and you can get referrals to see specialists without having to see him first.  really, what more do you need?  i'm sitting here trying to think of any complaints i have about him, but i'm really drawing a blank.","Dr. Goldberg embodies all the qualities I desire in a primary care physician. He is approachable yet respectful and punctual when it comes to appointments. Being affiliated with a renowned hospital like NYU provides reassurance in case of surgical intervention. Additionally, he allows patients to seek specialist consultations without requiring prior meetings with him. Frankly, I cannot envision any drawbacks associated with his practice.",0,1,0,1
1,"Unfortunately, the frustration of being Dr. Goldberg's patient is a repeat of the experience I've had with so many other doctors in NYC -- good doctor, terrible staff.  It seems that his staff simply never answers the phone.  It usually takes 2 hours of repeated calling to get an answer.  Who has time for that or wants to deal with it?  I have run into this problem with many other doctors and I just don't get it.  You have office workers, you have patients with medical needs, why isn't anyone answering the phone?  It's incomprehensible and not work the aggravation.  It's with regret that I feel that I have to give Dr. Goldberg 2 stars.","The recurring issue of dealing with unresponsive staff at Dr. Goldberg's office is sadly familiar to me, as it is to many patients seeking medical attention in New York City. Despite Dr. Goldberg being a competent physician, his staff's tendency to not answer the phone presents a frustrating obstacle. It's exasperating to spend up to two hours or more calling repeatedly just to get a response. I'm not alone in this - this is a common problem I've faced with other medical professionals in the area. It's perplexing why, with office staff available and patients with pressing medical concerns, calls are not being answered. It's unfathomable and adds unnecessary stress. I reluctantly must give Dr. Goldberg only two stars due to this persistent issue.",1,1,1,1
2,"Been going to Dr. Goldberg for over 10 years. I think I was one of his 1st patients when he started at MHMG. He's been great over the years and is really all about the big picture. It is because of him, not my now former gyn Dr. Markoff, that I found out I have fibroids. He explores all options with you and is very patient and understanding. He doesn't judge and asks all the right questions. Very thorough and wants to be kept in the loop on every aspect of your medical health and your life.","I have been seeing Dr. Goldberg at MHMG for more than a decade now. As one of his first patients, he has been an exceptional doctor all these years. He is focused on the big picture and helps his patients explore all possible options. Dr. Goldberg is very considerate, and he never judges his patients. He always asks insightful questions and is very thorough in his examination. He truly cares about his patients' medical health and wants to be informed about all aspects of their lives. It was thanks to him that I discovered I had fibroids, not my previous gynecologist, Dr. Markoff.",0,1,1,1
3,Got a letter in the mail last week that said Dr. Goldberg is moving to Arizona to take a new position there in June.  He will be missed very much.  \n\nI think finding a new doctor in NYC that you actually like might almost be as awful as trying to find a date!,Received news via mail that Dr. Goldberg will be relocating to Arizona in June for a fresh opportunity. His absence shall be deeply felt. The challenge of discovering a new physician in New York City whom you actually approve of might be just as daunting as searching for a romantic partner!,0,1,0,1
4,"I don't know what Dr. Goldberg was like before  moving to Arizona, but let me tell you, STAY AWAY from this doctor and this office. I was going to Dr. Johnson before he left and Goldberg took over when Johnson left. He is not a caring doctor. He is only interested in the co-pay and having you come in for medication refills every month. He will not give refills and could less about patients's financial situations. Trying to get your 90 days mail away pharmacy prescriptions through this guy is a joke. And to make matters even worse, his office staff is incompetent. 90% of the time when you call the office, they'll put you through to a voice mail, that NO ONE ever answers or returns your call. Both my adult children and husband have decided to leave this practice after experiencing such frustration. The entire office has an attitude like they are doing you a favor. Give me a break! Stay away from this doc and the practice. You deserve better and they will not be there when you really need them. I have never felt compelled to write a bad review about anyone until I met this pathetic excuse for a doctor who is all about the money.","I had been seeing Dr. Johnson for some time before he retired and Dr. Goldberg took over. In my opinion, Dr. Goldberg's approach to patient care is lacking. He seems more focused on making money and scheduling appointments for monthly medication refills than on providing quality care. Additionally, getting prescriptions filled through his office can be a challenge, and the office staff is often unresponsive. After several frustrating experiences, both my family members and I have decided to seek healthcare elsewhere. I wouldn't recommend this doctor or practice to anyone else seeking compassionate care.",1,1,0,1
5,Top notch doctor in a top notch practice. Can't say I am surprised when I was referred to him by another doctor who I think is wonderful and because he went to one of the best medical schools in the country. \nIt is really easy to get an appointment. There is minimal wait to be seen and his bedside manner is great.,"I was pleased to be recommended to this exceptional doctor who practices in a top-tier medical facility. I am not surprised by his caliber as he was educated at one of the nation's finest medical schools.

We feel grateful to have him as our physician nearby and wish to continue being his patients in the long run.",0,1,0,1
7,"I'm writing this review to give you a heads up before you see this Doctor. The office staff and administration are very unprofessional. I left a message with multiple people regarding my bill, and no one ever called me back. I had to hound them to get an answer about my bill. \n\nSecond, and most important, make sure your insurance is going to cover Dr. Goldberg's visits and blood work. He recommended to me that I get a physical, and he knew I was a student because I told him. I got the physical done. Later, I found out my health insurance doesn't pay for preventative visits. I received an $800.00 bill for the blood work. I can't pay for my bill because I'm a student and don't have any cash flow at this current time. I can't believe the Doctor wouldn't give me a heads up to make sure my insurance would cover work that wasn't necessary and was strictly preventative. The office can't do anything to help me cover the bill. In addition, the office staff said the onus is on me to make sure my insurance covers visits. Frustrating situation!","Prior to seeing Dr. Goldberg, it's important to note that the office staff and administration are unprofessional. I left multiple messages regarding my bill and didn't receive a call back until I kept reminding them. Also, ensure that your insurance covers Dr. Goldberg's visits and blood work. I received a physical on his recommendation, only to find out that my insurance doesn't pay for preventative visits, which resulted in an $800 bill for the blood work. The doctor didn't inform me and the office is unable to assist with the bill. It's your responsibility to ensure your insurance will cover visits, which is frustrating.",1,1,1,1
8,"Wing sauce is like water. Pretty much a lot of butter and some hot sauce (franks red hot maybe).  The whole wings are good size and crispy, but for $1 a wing the sauce could be better. The hot and extra hot are about the same flavor/heat.  The fish sandwich is good and is a large portion, sides are decent.","Wing sauce can be compared to water, as it is usually made with a generous amount of butter and a dash of hot sauce, maybe Franks Red Hot. Although the wings themselves are large and crispy, the sauce could be improved for the price of $1 per wing. The hot and extra hot variations have a similar level of heat and flavor. Apart from the wings, the fish sandwich is also delicious and comes in a generous serving size, while the sides are decent.",1,1,0,1
9,"Decent range somewhat close to the city.  The mats are pretty solid; however, the grass range needs to be tended too.  It's like hitting out of US Open type rough...not very amenable to practicing.  Which kind of defeats the purpose of going to a golf range...Still gets 3 stars because the range is lit up at night which is excellent for those of us who are addicted to this amazing game, but are somewhat short on time (having a job kinda sucks sometimes, no?).","The golf range offers a good selection of options and is conveniently located near the city. The quality of the mats is satisfactory, although the grass range could use some improvement as it feels like hitting out of rough terrain. Despite this, the range is still rated 3 stars due to its convenient night lighting, providing an opportunity for busy individuals to continue practicing their favorite game.",1,1,0,1
10,"Owning a driving range inside the city limits is like a license to print money.  I don't think I ask much out of a driving range.  Decent mats, clean balls and accessible hours.  Hell you need even less people now with the advent of the machine that doles out the balls.  This place has none of them.  It is april and there are no grass tees yet.  BTW they opened for the season this week although it has been golfing weather for a month.  The mats look like the carpet at my 107 year old aunt Irene's house.  Worn and thread bare.  Let's talk about the hours.  This place is equipped with lights yet they only sell buckets of balls until 730.  It is still light out.  Finally lets you have the pit to hit into.  When I arrived I wasn't sure if this was a driving range or an excavation site for a mastodon or a strip mining operation.  There is no grass on the range. Just mud.  Makes it a good tool to figure out how far you actually are hitting the ball.  Oh, they are cash only also.\n\nBottom line, this place sucks.  The best hope is that the owner sells it to someone that actually wants to make money and service golfers in Pittsburgh.","Running a driving range in the city is a lucrative opportunity, as long as it meets some basic requirements. Customers expect clean balls, decent mats, and reasonable hours. New technology also means fewer people are needed to operate the range. Unfortunately, the driving range I visited doesn't live up to these standards. It's already April and the grass tees are still not available, even though the weather has been perfect for golfing for over a month. The mats are worn down and the hours are limited, even though the range has lights. When I arrived, it almost looked like an excavation site or strip mining operation, there was so much mud and no grass on the range. The only saving grace is that it can help you measure your shot distance. Plus, they only accept cash. All in all, this driving range is a disappointment. Hopefully, the owner will find someone who cares about satisfying golfers and earning revenue for Pittsburgh.",1,1,0,1

The staff is extremely friendly.  My Mom & I each had the fish sandwich, while my Dad & Brother had a Reuben sandwich.  The fish was very good, but the Reuben was to die for!  Both dishes were massive, and could very easily be shared between two people.  On top of being extremely large portions, it was incredibly affordable.  The giant fish sandwich was $8 and the giant Reuben was $7.50.  Our drinks were always filled and we were checked on several times during the meal.  We will definitely be back!!!

The restaurant has definitely been around for a while and it shows. If you're someone who cares about the ambiance of a restaurant, then this might not be the place for you. However, if you enjoy pretending you're on a movie set in Pittsburgh from 30 years ago, then this place is definitely worth checking out.

The food is AMAZING! I can't stress this enough. I forget about any little complaints I had once the food arrives at the table. Some of my favorites include the Fish Sandwich, the huge and delicious Salmon, the Flounder, and the different ways they prepare the Shrimp.

19,"After a morning of Thrift Store hunting, a friend and I were thinking of lunch, and he suggested Emil's after he'd seen Chris Sebak do a bit on it and had tried it a time or two before, and I had not. He said they had a decent Reuben, but to be prepared to step back in time.\n\nWell, seeing as how I'm kind of addicted to late 40's and early 50's, and the whole Rat Pack scene, stepping back in time is a welcomed change in da burgh...as long as it doesn't involve 1979, which I can see all around me every day.\n\nAnd yet another shot at finding a decent Reuben in da burgh...well, that's like hunting the Holy Grail. So looking under one more bush certainly wouldn't hurt.\n\nSo off we go right at lunchtime in the middle of...where exactly were we? At first I thought we were lost, driving around a handful of very rather dismal looking blocks in what looked like a neighborhood that had been blighted by the building of a highway. And then...AHA! Here it is! And yep, there it was. This little unassuming building with an add-on entrance with what looked like a very old hand painted sign stating quite simply 'Emil's. \n\nWe walked in the front door, and entered another world. Another time, and another place. Oh, and any Big Burrito/Sousa foodies might as well stop reading now. I wouldn't want to see you walk in, roll your eyes and say 'Reaaaaaalllly?'\n\nThis is about as old world bar/lounge/restaurant as it gets. Plain, with a dark wood bar on one side, plain white walls with no yinzer pics, good sturdy chairs and actual white linens on the tables. This is the kind of neighborhood dive that I could see Frank and Dino pulling a few tables together for some poker, a fish sammich, and some cheap scotch. And THAT is exactly what I love.\n\nOh...but good food counts too. \n\nWe each had a Reuben, and my friend had a side of fries. The Reubens were decent, but not NY awesome. A little too thick on the bread, but overall, tasty and definitely filling. Not too skimpy on the meat. I seriously CRAVE a true, good NY Reuben, but since I can't afford to travel right now, what I find in da burgh will have to do. But as we sat and ate, burgers came out to an adjoining table. Those were some big thick burgers. A steak went past for the table behind us. That was HUGE! And when we asked about it, the waitress said 'Yeah, it's huge and really good, and he only charges $12.99 for it, ain't that nuts?' Another table of five came in, and wham. Fish sandwiches PILED with breaded fish that looked amazing. Yeah, I want that, that, that and THAT!\n\nMy friend also mentioned that they have a Chicken Parm special one day of the week that is only served UNTIL 4 pm, and that it is fantastic. If only I could GET there on that week day before 4...\n\nThe waitress did a good job, especially since there was quite a growing crowd at lunchtime on a Saturday, and only one of her. She kept up and was very friendly. \n\nThey only have Pepsi products, so I had a brewed iced tea, which was very fresh, and she did pop by to ask about refills as often as she could. As the lunch hour went on, they were getting busy.\n\nEmil's is no frills, good portions, very reasonable prices, VERY comfortable neighborhood hole in the wall...kind of like Cheers, but in a blue collar neighborhood in the 1950's. Fan-freakin-tastic! I could feel at home here.\n\nYou definitely want to hit Mapquest or plug in your GPS though. I am not sure that I could find it again on my own...it really is a hidden gem. I will be making my friend take me back until I can memorize where the heck it is.\n\nAddendum: 2nd visit for the fish sandwich. Excellent. Truly. A pound of fish on a fish-shaped bun (as opposed to da burgh's seemingly popular hamburger bun). The fish was flavorful, the batter excellent, and for just $8. This may have been the best fish sandwich I've yet to have in da burgh.","After a morning of browsing through thrift stores, my friend suggested we try Emil's for lunch. He had eaten there before and recommended it as a time capsule to the late 40s and early 50s. Although I'm a fan of that era's Rat Pack scene, I was hesitant about the food, especially since I'm on a quest for the perfect Reuben sandwich in this city. Nevertheless, we found Emil's in a blighted-looking neighborhood, and the unassuming bar/lounge/restaurant looked like a place where Frank and Dino would enjoy a casual game of poker and a fish sandwich. We ordered the Reubens and, while they weren't the best we've had, they were decent and filling. But it was the homemade burgers, steaks, and fish sandwiches that caught our eyes and noses, and we vowed to come back for them. The service was great, and the waitress recommended the Chicken Parm special served only during weekdays before 4 pm. The only downside was that they only served Pepsi products, but the brewed iced tea was fresh and refillable. In short, Emil's is a no-frills, comfort-food diner with reasonable prices and a welcoming atmosphere, and a hidden gem that's worth the effort to find.",1,1,0,1

It is refreshing to walk into a townie bar and not feel like the music stops and everyone in the place is staring at you - I'm guessing the mixed crowd of older hockey fans, young men in collared shirts, and thirtysomethings have probably seen it all during their time at this place. \n\nThe staff was top notch - the orders were somewhat overwhelming as they appeared short-staffed for the night, but my waitress tried to keep a positive attitude for my entire visit. The other waiter was wearing a hooded cardigan, and I wanted to steal it from him due to my difficulty in finding such a quality article of clothing.\n\nWe ordered a white pizza - large in size, engulfed in cheese, full of garlic flavor, flavorful hot sausage. An overall delicious pizza, aside from 2 things: 1, way too much grease (I know this comes with the territory, but still, it is sometimes unbearable); 2, CANNED MUSHROOMS - the worst thing to come out of a can.

The mushroom debacle is enough to lower the review by an entire star - disgusting!\n\nMy advice for the place is keep everything awesome - random music from the jukebox, tasty food, great prices, good crowd and staff - and get some decent mushrooms; why they spoil an otherwise above average pie with such inferior crap, I'll never know.","I stumbled upon a charming townie bar with great food and a diverse group of patrons during my Friday night commute from the airport.

The staff was incredibly accommodating, despite the fact that they were short-staffed for the night. My waitress was a delight, and whilst the orders were somewhat overwhelming, she remained positive throughout my visit. I made note of a second waiter who had a fantastic hooded cardigan, which I was strongly tempted to steal. \n\nWe opted for the white pizza, which was generously covered in cheese, garlic flavor, and flavorful hot sausage, making it a delectable treat. However, there were two noticeable drawbacks to the pizza: firstly, the excessive grease, which can be a common issue, but it was almost unbearable. Secondly, the canned mushrooms. I cannot stress enough how terrible canned mushrooms can be. It was so unappetizing that it's enough to lower the rating of the establishment by an entire star. \n\nMy advice for the place is to maintain the excellent array of music from the jukebox, lower prices, welcoming crowd and staff, and above all, opt for better quality mushrooms in their otherwise above-average pie.

27,"I will start by saying we have a nice new deck. That is where the good part ends.\n\nWhy two stars if we have a nice deck now? Well, it all started in May when we had a man named Al come out and talk to us about the process. He was a true salesman, I'll tell you that. Not a straight shooter, but an excited salesman that wanted to sell... And we bought into it.\n\nHe told us they were backed up with the harsh winter and a lot of jobs, but they could probably start by June 24th. Mind you, this was the end of May we met with him. He said they would have to do a survey of our land and get a permit from Dormont before they started. We felt confident in going with them, and booked it.\n\nHere's where things fell apart. Weeks went by with no word from them on the process. Finally I called and left messages. Al finally got in touch with me and the conversation was utterly confusing. He must have not understood me because he just kept talking in circles. So I hung up not knowing what was going on. Finally I called back and the admin told me that the survey could take a couple weeks to come back. I wish Al would have told us that.\n\nSo our June 24th date came and went. We finally got our survey. And they were quick to bill us for it, but no word on where we were in the process. I called back a couple times with no real answers from the admin. Apparently they were now waiting for the permit from Dormont.\n\nA month later, I was frustrated and asked to speak with someone at the company. I spoke with someone who told me that Dormont usually takes a week to process the permit, but we were now going on a month. He told me he would bug the guy about it and we finally got it. \n\nI completely understand that waiting on the permit is not their fault, but why no communication about it? Just call me and tell me they're waiting for the permit, but they'll work towards asking Dormont what the hold up is. Seems simple.\n\nFinally we get the permit and work is supposed to start. Tuesday comes and they have to wait for approval from Dormont on holes they're digging. So holes are dug and equipment is put in my backyard and then nothing happens for two days. Where did everyone go? Who knows, because I wasn't informed! \n\nI was upset and contacted the company owner, Dave, by email. I told him how frustrated I was about the lack of communication. He wrote me two sentences that  said \""there will be acres there tomorrow morning to finish and most will be done tomorrow.\"" Well, that didn't happen.\n\nThen two other dudes show up two days later and did work for about three hours and left. The main guy comes back the next day and says they did it wrong. So apparently the part about how they wouldn't need access to my house changes to they're drilling bolts into my house to secure he deck. \n\nFinally, the second week into construction, my tiny 10x11 foot deck is done. It was upsetting that they left the deck dirty, and all the dirt and cement they moved around wasn't cleaned up. I even asked them to fill all the holes they dug up and didn't use, and they only filled up one. When you create a construction project, isn't it just good business to clean it up and make it look nice? Didn't happen here.\n\nMy main point is, contractors have a reputation for not being the most trustworthy. Why be that company? Why not be an upstanding company that consumers can trust? My main issues with them were that things were not communicated to me properly up front, nor was the ongoing process communicated to me. Then they left everything unfinished in my eyes, leaving the site dirty. I understand things happen and things get delayed, but just email or call me. It's not that hard to keep me updated, it is 2014 with a million ways to be contacted.\n\nEven though I have a nice deck (after I clean things up myself!), I would not recommend them to anyone.","Despite having a new deck, my experience with the company was quite disappointing. A salesman named Al promised us that the construction would start by June 24th, but we faced constant delays and poor communication throughout the process. Even though the delays were not entirely their fault, they could have kept me updated at every step. The workers left the deck dirty and unfinished, and failed to fill up all the holes they dug up. I believe that it's important to be an upstanding company that consumers can trust, and unfortunately, this company didn't live up to that expectation.",0,1,0,1

31,"Two meals, on the recommendation of a friend who lives near the place, and after the second trip, I was compelled to write. 'Rocky' would definitely describe the experiences.\n\nOn the first trip, I went to try their (at that time)raved about Reuben. And YET to find a true good Reuben in da burgh, I tried it.\n\nWell, they were out of the proper bread, and the guy had to run to the store to buy the closest thing he could find, which was not the proper bread, and instead of one of their 'raved about' Reubens, I received two mini-Reubens, which basically took the guts from one Reuben, and spread it out onto two sandwiches on regular sized bread. I ate it. It wasn't great, but they swore it was because they'd run out of the bread. Bread or not, it still wasn't great. The atmosphere was pleasant in that 'blue collar bar' kind of way, and the staff was very nice, but not a winning pitch on the Reuben.\n\nThe second trip was after a long day of moving furniture with the same friend. Sat in the back room, instead of the bar, which felt more like a restaurant, of course, with the big screen TV covering the sports of the moment.\n\nI was in the mood for dinner this time, and after a scan, decided on fried chicken and mashed potatoes with the salad bar. My friend ordered one of her faves, the breaded pork chops.\n\nWe hit the salad bar, which was uber-basic. Three soups (mostly vegetable loaded, which left me out), basic iceberg lettuce mix (very probably out of a bag), a few veggie toppings, and three or four dressings. It was a basic salad, no big deal. More or less an appetizer filler before the meal.\n\nThe mind-blower in this trip was the ordering of the fried chicken dinner. Our waiter looked like a 19 year old gas station attendant, skinny little blonde guy with a sweet but incredibly naive face, and an air of vapidity, which was confirmed when I placed my order. I asked what chicken pieces came in the dinner, and asked if it was possible to only get dark meat. I never imagined how confusing a question that could possibly be. It literally took him two trips back to the kitchen to 'ask', and the child honestly had no clue what 'white meat' and 'dark meat' meant. The first answer he came back with was that the chicken came in a pre-portioned prepared bag, kind of Kentucky Fried Chicken style...which didn't answer my question, thus prompting the second trip. \n\nAfter the second trip back I heard the cook holler 'Tell him I'll fix him up'. \n\nWell, the chicken was prepackaged dreck like you'd find in the freezer case of Walmart, tiny and not good, and the potatoes had that slight tinge of chem-spuds flavor, laden with some kind of chopped up green (parsley?), and a side of that basic brown gravy served up in 5 gallon buckets.\n\nThank goodness for the basic salad bar.\n\nEven my friend admitted that her pork chops were different and not what she'd expected. They also appeared to be from a freezer bag.\n\nThe irony was that the boy who didn't know white meat from dark meat, was chatting with some other customers...about baseball...and he was a genius about the mindless sport of baseball. Ahhhh da burgh.\n\nThird base? Nah...why bother when there are so many other options around. Go on in a grab a beer and chat black and gold if you happen to be in Carnegie...they can help you out all types of ways in that area. Just don't go hungry if you actually have tastebuds.\n\nFrom what I understand it 'used to be' really good homecooked food. But apparently, mama has left the kitchen.","I had two meals at a place that was recommended by a friend who lives nearby, and my experiences were not the best. During my first visit, I went to try their highly praised Reuben sandwich, but they were out of the proper bread and I ended up getting two mini-Reubens on regular bread which did not impress me. The atmosphere was nice, but the staff's excuse for the subpar sandwich did not make up for the disappointment. 

On my second visit, I ordered the fried chicken and mashed potatoes with a side salad. The salad bar was basic, and the waiter had a hard time understanding my order for dark meat only. Unfortunately, the chicken was not good and tasted like frozen food, and the potatoes had an artificial flavor. My friend's breaded pork chops were different than what she was expecting, and also seemed to come from a freezer bag. The only saving grace was the basic salad bar. 

It's a shame because I heard the food used to be great, but it seems like something has changed in the kitchen. If you happen to be in the area, you can stop by for a drink and chat about sports, but don't go with high expectations for the food.",0,1,0,1

I've usually visited for dinner and sat in the dining area, but today I decided to take an old friend for a mid-day meal at the bar. He opted for the large fish sandwich, which is one of Rocky's most popular items. This towering sandwich comes with three generously sized and perfectly fried fish fillets, served with fresh fries and still priced under $10. He ate so much that he had to take leftovers home! 

For my meal, I went with the grilled meatball sandwich, which was out of this world. The meatballs were juicy and savory, served on thick slices of fresh Italian bread and smothered in gooey melted mozzarella cheese. The tomato sauce was the perfect complement to the meatballs, and the side of fries completed the meal perfectly. I had to save half my sandwich for later, but it was just as delicious the second time around.

I can appreciate that some smaller businesses might have trouble installing a credit card system in their store/resturant, but could you perhaps provide an ATM?  In the past, this would deter me from eating at this place. \n\nLooking at a standard breakfast menu, I decided to go with a tuna melt instead. What I got was a cold tuna salad sandwich with a slice of cheese on toast. I had ordered a melt being in the mood for a warm meal, but to no avail. One day later I can't even remember what my side was. I suppose it didn't leave much of an impression on me.  I have to say that the dessert was really good! The cherry pecan pie!

Needless to say, I was disappointed. I can't even recall what my side dish was. Despite this, the cherry pecan pie for dessert was a standout. The tart cherries and sugary topping made it an unforgettable treat. 

Overall, my experience was lukewarm. As someone new to Pittsburgh, I'm starting to see the obsession with breakfast that locals have.

The decor had a charming country feel, but it was below average in terms of cleanliness. Moreover, there were several leaks in the roof which caused water to drip into buckets on the floor. Plus, a customer even took a tumble due to these buckets. Therefore, I'm rating the interior a 2/5.

On the positive side, the prices were reasonable. I was able to feed myself and two others breakfast for only $23, which is a plus. Hence, the prices get a 3/5.

52,"Some of the worst pizza I've ever had.  We used a coupon from the paper for a 2 topping 8 cut Sicilian. First of all the pizza wasn't even cut through, and the sad attempt at cutting was so uneven that 4 of the slices were about an inch wide, while the others were about 4\"" each. The toppings were scarce, they used mini pepperoni and put maybe 8 on the whole pizza. The onions were huge chunks and the mushrooms were straight from a can. The worst part though was the thick doughy crust that tasted more like a fishy sourdough roll. I'm serious... It was so noticeable that it made me wonder if the dough was bad or if they for some weird reason put fish sauce in it. It was gross. \n\nWe also ordered steak and Italian hoagies. The veggies were old and wilted, and there was no dressing on either. The Italian had deli meat that was clearly bottom of the line and not very generous. The \""steak\"" (if you an call it that) was greyish instead of brown and looked like it was a processed meat chopped into pieces. No flavor or seasoning and the texture was reminiscent of spam.

71,"What a wonderful surprise found in Carnegie PA, just south of Pittsburgh.  I was in town on business with a couple co-workers and after having a not so great meal the night before, we asked one of the locals for a recomendation.  They told us to try this little Italian place called Papa J's and boy did they send us to a great place.\n\nFirst off, when you walk up to the place, the front and side windows give you a fantastic open view into the kitchen from the outside.  You can stand outside and watch the chef making all the wonderful food and you can smell the fresh bread before you even walk in the door.\n\nI am not sure how long this place has been around but the kitchen looked well used, while the dining area as well as the bar looked very clean and modern, almost as if it had been freshly updated.  \n\nThe server was quick to welcome us and suggested several different items off the menu as his favorites when asked.  The three of us were very hungry and wanting to try a few different things, so we began with a Margherita pizza which was absolutely perfect.  They obviously make their own breads and dough for the pizza and I don't think this pizza could have tasted any better.  Then came bowls of Italian wedding soup which was pretty good.  Of everything there, this was the one item I probably could have done without.  Not that it was bad, but there was nothing particularly special about it.  \n\nWe also ordered the Garlic Rolls (not that the bread they already give you and the pizza was not enough carbs for 1 meal) and they were to die for.  Crunchy on the outside and warm and chewy inside, these things were a meal by themselves.  One of the guys with me said the pizza sauce would be good on them so he ordered a cup of the pizza sauce (which is fresh made there, not out of some can) and he was right.  As if these little killer bread balls with garlic were not good enough, dipped in the pizza sauce they were even that much better.  \n\nBy the time our meals came, we were all pretty full, but we pushed on and continued to eat.  I had the Veal Parmigiano which was tender and very good.  It came with a side of pasta which I tasted just to try and it was excelent as well.  Had I not been eating a weeks worth of carbs in one sitting with all the pre-meal stuff, I certainly would have finished it.  As it was, I ate most but not all of the generous portion of veal.  \n\nOne of my co-workers had the Chicken Picatta which he said was one of the best he had ever had and the other guy tried a pasta dish which he said was very good as well.  \n\nThey had a great wine selection as well at reasonable prices by the glass or bottle.\n\nOverall a fantastic experience with great food and atmosphere.  I don't really know how expensive the area is for food, but coming from the Chicagoland area, I fouknd this place to be pretty reasonable.  The three of us ate very very well for an average of aproximately $30 each not including alcahol.  Fantastic fresh food at a reasonable price, who could ask for more.\n\nMy only complaint is that I had to return to Chicago and I am now craving to return to Papa J's.  I hope work sends me out here again sometime soon!!!","I recently had a wonderful surprise dining experience at a small Italian restaurant called Mama Mia's in downtown Seattle. My friend and I were looking for a good meal and stumbled upon this hidden gem. Upon walking up to the restaurant, we were immediately drawn to the large windows that allowed us to peek into the kitchen where we saw the chef preparing fresh, homemade pasta. The aroma of garlic bread and tomato sauce wafted out onto the street, signaling that we were in for a treat. 

The interior of the restaurant was cozy and inviting, with modern decor and a warm, welcoming atmosphere. The server greeted us promptly and recommended several dishes from the menu. We started off with the antipasto platter, which was overflowing with cured meats, cheeses, and olives. It was the perfect starter to share between the two of us. 

For our entrees, my friend ordered the classic spaghetti and meatballs, while I opted for the chicken parmesan. Both dishes were beautifully presented and tasted even better than they looked. The chicken was crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside, and the pasta was cooked to perfection. As if we weren't full enough, the server convinced us to try the tiramisu for dessert, which was absolutely heavenly.

77,"I have to say that I write this review with much regret, because I have always loved PaPa J's. But my recent experience there has changed my mind a bit. \n\nFrom the minute we were seated, we were greeted by a server that was clearly inexperienced and didn't know the menu. As I said before, I've been to PaPa J's a good handful of times so I know the menu decently well, but the server couldn't explain any of the questions I had about a couple new dishes I was thinking about trying. I swear this guy must have just looked at the menu for the first time a few minutes ago.\n\nBut it wasn't just the knowledge of the menu. It was one thing after another with our server. My wife asked for a glass of water 4 times until she finally got it (at which point the meal was over, so we didn't care at that point).  I mean come on, for a restaurant of this calibre and price is it too much to ask for a glass of water? There was no one filling up water.\n\nMy biggest complaint, however, is what happened with our meals. My dad and I both ordered the trout special (trout with roasted red peppers and lump crabmeat). Instead, the meal that was delivered to both of us was trout with a heaping pile of spinach and mushrooms. Not what the special was at all.  And by the way, that item is on the menu as a regular item so whether or not the mistake was made by the server (which, we are sure it was) or the chef, who knows for certain. Not to mention, though, that a good server wouldn't have served us that regardless. \n\nBut before you think we had an unusal experience that was all due to a poor server, let me continue. When we informed our server of the mistake, he didn't really believe us until he checked his order sheet, and then he blamed the error on the chef. At this point, the meal had been sitting (because it took us forever to flag this guy down again) so the trout was basically cold. The server then said he would have the meals re-made. So, he took the meals back to the kitchen. Meanwhile, of course, my wife and mom are eating their meals and my dad and I are sitting there with no meals. Also keep in mind that my wife still had not gotten the water she had been asking for, and my iced tea had been refilled with a soda (yes, believe that or not). All the kitchen did was scrape their \""mistake\"" off of our fish! They didn't remake anything. Our fish was served to us again with little pieces of spinach and mushrooms sticking all over it. Quite frankly, the fish wasn't good at all. I honestly would have rather had a fish sandwich from McDonald's that night. The server never did anything to try to make our experience better - he knew we weren't happy, but never offered anything such as dessert on the house. I'm not looking for a handout, but our experience was just plain awful that night. The guy never really even apologized for the mistake. Normally, I may have asked for a manager, but at this point I was ready to just get out of there (plus, we had to be somewhere else that night).\n\nMy opinion... for the money, there are many other restaurants I would rather eat at.","It is with regret that I write this review, as I have always held high regards for PaPa J's. However, my recent visit wasn't up to par. Our server was inexperienced and had little knowledge of the menu, making it difficult for me to decide on a dish I wanted to try. On top of that, our drinks were not being refilled and my wife had to ask for water four times before finally receiving it. When our meals arrived, my father and I received something completely different from what we had ordered. When we brought this to the server's attention, he didn't believe us at first and blamed the mistake on the chef. Instead of remaking the dish, the kitchen just scraped off the unwanted items and served it to us again. The entire experience was disappointing and the server didn't try to make it better. For the price, there are other restaurants I would rather dine at.",0,1,0,1

97,"THE WORST DENTAL EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE.  THEY ARE BUTCHERS!  My husband and I went to Emmert Dental in Bethel Park for a routine cleaning and check up.  I had one tooth that I had a recent root canal on and a few small cavities that needed filled.  After the so called dentist - Dr Carnavali - did my exam, I needed 3 additional root canals and an extraction! An extraction on the tooth that just had a root canal. I was told that part of the tooth had broken off and that a crown was no longer possible.  I didn't know any better, so I agreed to schedule the extraction for a few weeks later. The \""dentist\"" wanted to extract it that day, but I had plans for the weekend and was not about to be in pain. So, 2 weeks later, I went in for the extraction.  After they gave me novocaine they get me with \""you need a bone graft also in that area since we are extracting that tooth\"". I have never had any issues with bone loss with previous extractions so I didn't feel it was necessary. I had 3 employees surrounding me, pressuring me for this bone graft. So, I reluctantly agreed. I had to pay $259.00 for this \""bone graft\"". So, I signed everything. I wasn't even given enough time to read the document, so I should have known and got up and left right then and there. The \""dentist\"" started the extraction. I have never been so uncomfortable in my life. He pulled on my tooth, used a metal instrument to pound on my tooth and was pulling so hard that my head was coming up and slamming back down against the head rest.  Finally, after a good 15 minutes of this torture, he ripped the tooth out of the side of my jaw. I was literally ganging from all the blood running down the back of my throat. He then stuck some pink powder up in the extraction area. I'm assuming this was the bone graft.  I ended up with many stitches. I was given an antibiotic and instructed to schedule an appointment for the following Saturday so they could start the bridge. Then I was hit with a bill of $569.00! My insurance covers 100% of extractions.  I was in so much pain for 2 weeks following the extraction. Pain severe enough that I had to call off work and I couldn't sleep at night.  I refused to go back to Emmert Dental.  And after a visit to a very reputable dentist, an endodontist and an oral surgeon, I have to have oral surgery to try and repair the damage Emmert Dental has done to my mouth.  They caused a very large deformity in my jaw and I am at risk to lose additional teeth.  Save yourself a lot of time, money and pain.  Emmert dental only cares about the money, will over charge you and leave you less than happy with the dental work.  They are butchers and should not even call themselves dentist. And if you have an issue with their billing practices, don't expect to that resolved easily.  I have called numerous times and I am always told that the manager and or billing department is not in.  I have contacted the BBB and a lawyer.  I expect and want a full refund.  No one should have to go thru what I am currently going thru.  They do unnecessary extractions so they can do a more expensive procedure such as a bridge or an implant.  Now I have to go thru oral surgery, more pain and suffering and more time missed from work because of Emmert Dental.  And the root canals they said I needed, my current dentist and my endodontist both agreed that I do not need tooth canals.  In fact, the teeth are perfectly healthy.  They are crooks and butchers.","I had a terrible experience with a dental clinic called Emmert Dental in Bethel Park. My husband and I went for a routine cleaning and checkup.

The tooth had apparently broken off, and a crown was no longer possible. I reluctantly agreed to schedule the extraction for a later date, which cost me $259 for a ""bone graft"" that I didn't even need.

I saw others get their orders quickly, which made me question the competency of the staff. While there are a few hard workers, the rest seem apathetic and disorganized. As someone who has worked in fast food before, I understand that it's not easy, but this situation is unacceptable. I asked for a refund and refused their offer to make me a new coffee. I cannot recommend this McDonald's and will be going to Starbucks instead, where their iced coffees are better.",1,1,0,0

112,"I'm not a huge fan of this location. I think that it was oddly built- the small, alley-like front makes it difficult to get past people on your way to/from the bathroom or tables when it's busy. And there's hardly any tables to sit at. Furthermore, people tend to clog the front on their way in, which makes things particularly difficult (especially in the winter weather). The staff were pretty impersonal to be, but maybe that was due to the high traffic of the place and the time I was there. And the coffee that I had was cold- I'm sure it was probably the bottom of the batch. I'd probably only walk in here again if someone else suggested it before or after a movie or while we were shopping in the area.","Although the location has its merits, I am not particularly fond of it. The entrance is narrow, like an alley, which can be inconvenient when the place is crowded, and there are few tables to sit at. In addition, the entrance tends to get congested, making it difficult, especially during the winter season. The staff was not particularly welcoming, but that may have been due to the busy period and my timing of my visit.

And sometimes they used vulgar language which was just unnecessary since they would have otherwise still been hilarious. Also there was no table service, and the only bartender was a bitch. I'll probably be back, but only for a special occasion when I can afford it.","Sing Sing made my bachelor party a night to remember, with dueling pianists who not only rocked the house with requested tunes but also poked fun at me in their lyrics. We continued the fun at the adjacent Rock Bottom restaurant and enjoyed some delicious food. However, the lack of crowd on a Thursday night affected the atmosphere, and the staff's persistence in soliciting tips left us a bit displeased. The use of vulgar language was unnecessary, although they were otherwise hilarious. The absence of table service and the unfriendly bartender made the experience a bit less enjoyable.

I called to find out how much they might charge to install some brakes and rotors that I had, i was reffered to Mark, the mechanic. I made the appointment with him for Tuesday Sept 30th, he quoted me between $179 - $200 for the work (though the first person I spoke to quoted $150-$179) and told me to bring it at 8am and it would be finished the same day.when I brought it on Tuesday, Septempber 30th at 8 am, Mark forgets that i even made the appointment with him (or didnt bother to make a note of it) saying, \""oh, I thought you were supposed to bring this by yesterday\"". He says I should expect this to probably be done before 3pm. \n\nI soon recieve a call from Mark at 10:25am, where he tells me the charge will actually be $240 (for four hours of labor + $13 worth of materials, before even getting started to see how long the job would actually take) and that the car would be ready by 3pm, if not possibly before that. Also for good measure he decides to randomly throw in, \""oh, and we don't take checks\"". \n\nThe next phone call is at 3:50pm to ask if i actually need to have the car back today, I tell Mark, \""yes, of course\"". (I was expecting to be ready by 3, if not before like he said) When I express that I definitely need it today, he says that he just has to finish this one side and it will be ready by 415. This leaves me with barely enough time to get a bus and get over there before they close at 430. Honestly if what he had to finish on my car could easily be completed between 3:50 and 4:15, i dont think he would bother asking if i still needed to have it that day.

The place is gigantic, with tables and serving areas everywhere, yet on a Saturday at 6PM, the hostess told us (after interrupting us three times to chat with the other hostess) told us it would be a three hour wait, despite the fact that there were empty tables all over the dining room. I suspect this is a ploy to get you to play games and spend money until you're table is ready, but the food at Dave and Buster's is not worth a three hour wait on any day.\nThe hostess told us we could be served right away if we went to the midway and found an empty table, so we attempted that. Most of those tables were empty with usually one or two adults at a giant empty table filled with coats who informed us that they needed the table because their kids would be back soon after playing games.

I would walk up to people paying their check, ask if I could have their table when they were done, and they would inform me that there were already two or three people who asked them and I should get in line.\nFinally, we found a table and proceeded to spend two hours eating dinner. It wasn't because we ordered a lot of food- it was that the waiter took forever to bring our food out. He seemed to have no problem getting us fresh drinks, until we drank as much as we could and then asked for water. After that, he seemed to come around a lot less. \nI had the build your own chicken tacos, which comes on a giant plate with all kinds of fixings.

The chicken was a bit dry and in some places you can tell it was left on the grill a little too long.  There were actually some bites that all I could taste was charred meat.  There wasn't enough BBQ sauce on the the chicken either.  The broccoli appeared to have been cooked prior and then thrown back into a pan to be seared.  Some of my broccoli actually had some burnt crisp areas on it.  Also I noticed that there were still some leaves left on the broccoli.  The mashed potatoes I wanted to like (which I hoped would be the best part of the dish, I'm a bit of a potato freak), but alas, I was let down. *sad face* They were cold and such a tiny portion.  With a tiny amount of shredded cheese and bacon but into that divot they made with the scoop to get it out of it's container.  Oh food, how if I didn't need you to survive, I wouldn't complain about you.\n\nThe building right now is in disarray.  They are in the midst of a remodel with lovely plastic curtains covering up certain sections of their dining area.  No bar out in the dining area right now and the pool tables were absent as well.  If you wanted a drink you had to go back into the game room.\n\nSpeaking of the game room, by far the best part.  With the meal I ordered I got the $20 play card (the best part of the meal, super charge it for $3 more and it's even better).  The game room  you can tell is in need of an update.  The carpet is worn and other signs of wear are noticeable as well.  One good thing is the games.  They change them up so often that there is always something new once you return.  Who knew that playing Connect 4 could be so fun, or for that matter Skee Ball rises to the top of my list to play.\n\nI will return again, but only after I eat elsewhere first.","Dave & Buster's is like a playground for adults, and my recent visit did not disappoint. Although the food was a bit of a letdown, the staff were fantastic - polite, prompt and attentive. My BBQ chicken was dry in places and lacked sufficient BBQ sauce, and the accompanying broccoli had burnt crisp areas and leaves left on it. The mashed potatoes were also disappointing with a tiny portion size and cold temperature. However, the game room more than made up for it. I received a $20 play card with my meal, which was the highlight of the experience. The games in the room are updated frequently, which makes every visit a new adventure. Although the building is currently being remodeled and some areas are covered up with plastic curtains, the game room is the main attraction and makes it all worthwhile. Despite the disappointing food, I will be back - but I'll make sure to eat elsewhere first!",0,1,0,1
186,Mediocre service. COLD food! Our food waited so long the lettuce & pickles wilted. Bland food. Crazy overpriced. Long waits in the arcade. 1 beer per hour maximum.  Avoid at all costs. Fair manager.,Below average service. FRIGID dishes! The vegetables and condiments turned stale due to prolonged waits. Tasteless dishes. Exorbitantly expensive. Extended waiting times in the gaming area. Only one beer per hour allowed. Steer clear of this place. Reasonable manager.,1,1,1,1
187,"Not being from the area, I traveled an hour to come here from Uniontown, PA. I was excited! I haven't been to this Dave and Buster's since I was younger and was ready to go back and play me some games! I went with my cousins, mind you, we hadn't ate all day and were very hungry. So, we decided to do the Eat & Play Combo, naturally. Here's where it gets bad. First of all, we get a very snobby hostess that shows us to our table. Then, we wait...and wait...and finally after about 25 mins we get a waitress. Her name was Ashley. We had plenty of time to decide what we wanted, so we quickly put our order in. Next, we were sitting and talking, waiting, we had empty glasses and our waitress had never even come around to see if we needed refills except for one time. She said she'd come back right away with our refills...yea, right. 20 mins later we get our refills. Mind you, our food still hasn't came yet. I see other people getting their food that had come in after us. I was frustrated. After waiting 45 mins for our food, I asked to speak with a manager. One of the servers who I asked replied rudely with \""Well, he's really busy right now. I doubt he'll be able to come out and talk to you\"". Finally, 15 mins later...that's one hour, folks. We get our food. What do you think the next problem was? Yep, the food was cold. I was completely fed up at this point, and told my waitress how disappointed I was, especially after driving one hour just to have this terrible service. The manager never came to speak with me, and we didn't even receive our meals for free. The only compensation we got were $10 game cards. Woopty-doo. The only thing good about this place is the games, but the prizes you get for your tickets are all junk and worthless. So, in conclusion...I DO NOT RECOMMEND THE WATERFRONT DAVE AND BUSTERS OF HOMESTEAD, PA. It was horrible, and I will not be returning for a very long time!","I traveled from Uniontown, PA to visit this Dave and Buster's location and was excited to play some games with my cousins.

Frustrated, I asked to speak with a manager, but was told they were too busy to speak with me. To make matters worse, we did not receive any compensation for our poor service, only $10 game cards which we found to be disappointing.

193,"My boyfriend and I are in our 20s, and have visited this D&B multiple times. After our visit yesterday, however, I don't think we'll be back. When we arrived we were greeted by a long line of people waiting to buy game cards. At first there were 2 extremely slow workers trying to do this, then one left while the line was still out the door! The girl that was left was more than incompetent, and was taking extremely long to fill these game cards. We stood in line for over 20 minutes before being told that there was another attendant in the actual game room. Needless to say, the line in the game room was just as long, and they still only had one girl in the booth. It was a Saturday! After we finally got our cards we had to wait yet again to get a beer. 2 bartenders on staff while the bar was completely full. It took us almost an hour before we actually could start gaming. The floors were filthy with trash, and the bathrooms: repulsive! I had to use the restrooms twice during our visit, and not only did both bathrooms I used have no toilet paper in them, but there was TP all over the floors, and the sinks were less than cleanly. My boyfriend mentioned that the guys restroom was no better, as it smelled like pee and the paper towel dispenser didn't work. All I have to say is get your crap together. We could see a difference in the type of crowed that was there on Saturday compared to what it used to be, and I'm I have no doubt it's due to the poor service and attention to cleanliness. For how expensive they are they need to staff better on weekends. It's a shame how quickly this place has gone down hill and we will NOT be returning anytime soon!","After visiting this D&B multiple times, my boyfriend and I were disappointed by our recent visit. Upon arrival, we were met with a long line of people waiting to purchase game cards. Despite the initial presence of two workers, one left before the line was even halfway done.

The floors were filthy and the bathrooms were in terrible condition, with no toilet paper in sight and various messes all over the place. We noticed that the type of crowd there on a Saturday was different from what it used to be, which we believe is due to the poor service and unsanitary conditions.

195,"ehh, 3.5 -- I can't rate it super low because i do smile a lot during my visits. Speaking of that, I've been here a few times, but never wrote a review for D&B. \n\nI'm a kid at heart and honestly do enjoy the games. However, there have been multiple instances where I swiped my game card & it took my credits, but no game began. There have also been times that I won and no tickets were released. I guess nothing is perfect but it does happen atleast once a visit (each scenerio)  It's hard to find a worker walking around and for half-price games, you kind of just take your loss with the 1.3 credits for skee ball (hmph!)\n\nThe food- it really isnt anything too fancy. I've had okay food, but super long wait times for a simple chicken fingers & fries for example. It's your basic sandwiches, salads, appetizers & a few pastas. I believe all sandwiches & burgers are around $10 & served with fries.  You can get the Eat & Play deal which includes food from a specific menu + a game card. Besides the game card deal, if you wanted to make D&B a date night you might be better off heading to another place to eat in Waterfront for amazing food.. but to each their own.  Try it once I suppose. The brownie sundae that i devoured last night was satisfying (2 brownies, 2 scoops of ice cream.. one with chocolate syrup; the other with raspberry sauce & fresh strawberries. Oh & whip cream)\n\nDrinks- pretty weak. We ordered 2 liquid maryjanes (2 each that is) which are filled with multiple shots of alchy & didn't really catch a buzz. Oh welllll. They do have a happy hour from 5-7pm. I'd go during that time for the best deal. I believe cocktails are half off & $3 off  bottles of wine. I've never seen anyone walking around with a wine glass though lol. \n\nThe prizes- as others have noted, the prizes are a little cheap for the amount of tickets they \""cost\"" However, it's cool to leave with a D&B coffee mug, cup or shot glass. Last night for 2500 tickets we decided on magnetic-style dart board (1,300?) a coffee mug, a D&B glass (our plastic one bit the dust) & a D&B coffee travel mug.. I might be missing a few odds & ends.\n\nOverall it's a fun time but can be pricey. It's best to head here Wednesday for half price games or get the Eat & Play deal while dining. \n\nI can't lie though, I find myself smiling ear to ear a few times within those 3 hours (woah, seemed longer than amount of time :D ) Speaking of which, in that time-frame we played 250 credits (cost= $40) but it was half-price games.","I've been to Dave & Buster's a few times and while I enjoy the games, there have been a few frustrating instances where my game card didn't register credits or I didn't receive tickets for winning.

The prizes are a bit cheap for the amount of tickets they require, but it's still fun to leave with some souvenirs.

196,"Ok! Let me tell you about my bad experience first. I went to D&B last night for a post wedding party - which, side note, is a great idea!\n\nIt was around midnight and the bar wasn't really populated. There were three bartenders and only one was actually making rounds to see if anyone needed anything. The two other bartenders were chatting on the far side of the bar that no one was sitting at. Kind of counter productive if you ask me. \n\nI stood there for about 5 minutes, which for a busy bar is fine but when I am the only one with my card out then, it just seems a little ridiculous. I made eye contact with the one girl twice and gave her a smile and she literally turned away. I finally had to walk to them to get their attention.  I was standing right in front of them smiling and they didn't ask if i need anything. I finally said, \""Are you working?\"" and they gave each other a weird look. I felt like i was the crazy one. I asked for a beer/got the beer.\n\nIn between that time, the other bartender brought food over and set it down. She took a fry from the plate (right in front of me) and then served it to someone on the other side of the bar. What the hell! I felt like i was in some grimy bar in out in the sticks - not an established D&B. \n\nI was just really turned off from that experience. \n\nThe good is that D&B provides a different type of entertainment when you want to mix things up. I remember going here with my grandparents when I was a kid and it was the best treat ever! We would eat at the restaurant and then spend hours playing games.

197,"I used to love D&B when it first opened in the Waterfront, but it has gone down hill over the years. The games are not as fun and do not give you as many tickets and the prizes have gotten cheaper in quality. It takes a whole heck of a lot of tickets for you to even get a pencil! The atmosphere is okay but it used to be so much better with the funnest games and diverse groups of people! Now, it is run down and many of the games are app related games (Fruit Ninja) and 3D Experience rides. With such \""games\"", you can't even earn tickets and they take a lot of tokens! Last time I went, back in the winter, many of the games were broken, which made for a negative player experience. I would go to D&B to play some games again in the future, but it is no longer one of my favorite places to go due to the decline of fun games where you can earn tickets.","D&B at the Waterfront was my go-to spot back in the day, but it's been on the decline for a while now. The games just aren't as enjoyable, with fewer tickets to win and cheaper prizes. And forget about trying to earn anything good with the insane number of tickets you have to rack up - I mean, who wants a pencil as a reward? The atmosphere is still decent, but it's just not the same without the variety of games and people that used to be there. Nowadays, it feels like most of the offerings are just mobile apps and 3D rides, which don't even give you the chance to earn tickets.

The concept of playing classic and contemporary games, indulging in food and drinks under one roof sounds incredibly appealing. However, the hefty price tag may be a downside. That being said, there are a multitude of deals that the establishment offers depending on several factors. Knowing the specifics of these deals beforehand can help one get the most out of their visit. As far as the games are concerned, there is an abundance of options to choose from. While it may be tempting to go for the ticket-spitting games, opting for the two-hour arcade games can offer greater value for money, especially for those who enjoy playing Mario Kart.

202,"Rock Bottom Brewery in Homestead is always a good time.  They brew their own semi-micro brew here and generally have as many as eight brews to chose from.  Saturday night C and I stopped by to have a little dinner and enjoy some of their frosty beverages.  \n\nOur first issue of the night was getting to Rock Bottom.  As the restaurant is located in Homestead, a trip across the Hi Level Bridge was in order.  Little did we realize that the bridge was under construction and it took nearly 40 minutes to get across it.  Upon arriving at the restaurant we were presented with the task of finding a place to park which proved to be a daunting task.  This place was absolutely packed due to several locations sharing a parking lot.  After we got inside, our wait was about 45 minutes but luckily we were able to find a seat inside the packed bar while we waited.\n\nThe food at Rock Bottom is quite tasty, but it is all pretty standard bar fare with the nachos and burgers leading their menu.  They also have entrees such as steaks, but this place is not exactly known for their high class food products.  I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food and we quickly determined that this would not be your average plate of nachos in a bar.\n\nOur order consisted of a plethora of items from their appetizer menu including Chicken Nachos, Quesadillas and Ball Park Pretzels.  We had planned on splitting a meal for dinner, but by the time the appetizers arrived, we knew we had way too much food in front of us. \n\nThe nachos were on a gigantic plate and piled high with cheese, sour cream, guacamole and shredded chicken.  Containing just the right amount of jalapenos they had a nice little kick as well.  In much the same way, the quesadilla was much more than an appetizer portion.  With shredded meats and cheeses overflowing from the tortilla, there was enough food here for a two person entree.  The Ball Park Pretzels are the reason we come to this place.  They are always so light and soft with just the right amount of salt.\n\nAs far as the beers are concerned, I ordered up the sampler so that I could get a taste of the various brews.  They make a wide assortment of brews, from the Bud Lightesque \""Lumpy Dog\"" to a dark \""Brew masters Choice.\""  I found many of the beers to be quite tasty, however, nothing exactly special about them.  I would be that a taste test would find one hard pressed to chose the Rock Bottom brew over any off the shelf six pack.  Don't get me wrong - still excellent brews, but I would expect more from a place that claims to be a brewery.\n\nI give it 3 out of 5 Rinsem's due to the lack of originality in the brews and the amount of traffic involved with getting in and out of the place.","Rock Bottom Brewery in Homestead is a great place to grab a bite and enjoy some of their handmade brews. Though the location may be hard to find due to the current construction on the Hi Level Bridge, it's worth the visit. The restaurant itself was packed with patrons, with parking being a difficult task, but the delicious food and drinks made it all worthwhile. While they offer standard bar food, the quality of the dishes, such as the Chicken Nachos, Quesadillas, and Ball Park Pretzels, was quite impressive. Personally, I enjoyed the sampler of their various brews, though they didn't stand out as particularly unique compared to other beers. Regardless, Rock Bottom Brewery is a solid spot for a fun night out with friends, which I would rate 3 out of 5 Rinsem's.",0,1,0,1

211,"I always feel like I am constantly bashing breweries for their food, but in my opinion, I feel the bar is raised for places like this. It seems there are so many breweries out there that offer great beer, and slack off on the food. Unfortunately Rock Bottom is one that falls into that category. Let's be honest, when you go to a brewery, you want the full experience. If it was only about the beer, I'd go buy a growler and take it home. \n\nSo, about the beer....EXCELLENT!!!!! The Jagoff IPA is with out a doubt one of the best IPAs I have ever had! They only I can think of that I think is better is Dogfish Head, but that's a matter of opinion. The beer selection is constantly changing, and they always have some excellent seasonal beers. You can't go wrong, there's bound to be a beer everyone will like. \n\nAs for the food.......it's pretty much a crap shoot. Sometimes it's good, sometimes it's terrible. My biggest problem is there is absolutely no consistency when it comes to the food. One time it's perfect, then maybe it's cold, or it's burned, or it tastes completely different from the last time you had it. Unfortunately, it seems there is zero attention to food quality. \n\nThat's pretty much it. This place fixes it's food consistency, and it's a five star place. Till then, it's hit or miss!","It's no secret that breweries are expected to offer great food alongside their delicious beer, and while many succeed, some fall short. Rock Bottom is unfortunately one of those breweries that doesn't quite hit the mark. Of course, the beer selection is top-notch and always changing, with seasonal brews that are sure to please any taste. However, the food can be a bit of a gamble. While it can be tasty at times, there's no guarantee that your meal will always be consistent. If Rock Bottom can focus on improving the quality of their food, they have the potential to be a five-star establishment. Until then, it's simply hit or miss.",0,1,0,1

Watered down tomato juice with no discernible Peppar of any kind, let alone any other seasonings.  Even a good standard mix would have been better.

That went back and I went with a you-can't-screw-it-up Amaretto sour.  It was fine.\n\nHub ordered a Reuben - why, I'll never know because they simply never measure up to the gold standard of what used to be at the long-lamented Gazebo in Shadyside.

216,"I've always been pleasantly surprised with the food I've gotten at Rock Bottom.  I say \""surprised' because with any restaurant that falls into the slippery territory of a \""chain\"", you expect to find your fair share of culinary duds.  But I've really had a lot of good meals at Rock Bottom.  Now, granted, you do owe it to yourself when ordering to not forget where you are (a \""bar-straunt\"" if you will), and don't get anything above and beyond this place's call of duty.  For instance, I will never be ordering the ahi tuna.  I'll leave that to my favorite sushi bars and restaurants a bit closer to the water (the Mon doesn't count.....).\n\nBut besides that, I always really enjoy my meal choices.  I've recently gotten the chicken avocado sandwich.  Chicken was grilled perfectly, plenty of avocado, and it was a good sized sandwich without being excessive.  I've also ordered the Margherita pizza, which could definitely be split between two people.  It's an eight cut that comes to you on a big wooden pizza paddle.  The pizza was really great.  The crust was crispy, it had a good balance of cheese and tomatoes, and the basil pesto was fresh and tasty.  And not greasy whatsoever - BIG bonus points there.  But my biggest surprise as of late was when I ordered their chicken flautas.  I'm a HUGE Mexican food fan and always hesitate to order Mexican outside of a Mexican restaurant for fear of being disappointed.  But I had an insatiable craving one night and decided to go for it.  It was DELICIOUS.  The flautas are deep fried which gives you an amazing crunch, and they still managed to not dry out the inner ingredients.  The accompanying rice was nice and moist as well.  I was so happy!\n\nI've always been quite happy with the service there as well.  I go on Thursday evenings for trivia, and nine times out of ten the service is really spot on.  The ladies servicing the bar area are friendly and attentive.  Only once or twice, to my memory, has my service been sub-par, and that can usually be chalked up to an extremely packed Trivia Night with only two visible servers helping 50+ people.\n\nI definitely give Rock Bottom two thumbs up for taking your typical chain-found food and making it fresh, yummy, and worth coming back for more.","I've been pleasantly surprised with the food at Rock Bottom, considering it's a chain restaurant. You shouldn't expect fine dining, but they do a great job with their bar food. I highly recommend the chicken avocado sandwich, Margherita pizza, and chicken flautas.

217,"I went to Rock Bottom this past weekend, and it was \""nice\"" to see that nothing has changed in the year or two since my last visit.

If we hadn't REALLY wanted a cold beer after a comedy show at The Improv, we would've just left. It definitely wasn't busy enough to be noticed and ignored by the bartender, so I can't overlook it. Of course, the service has always been spotty at Rock Bottom, so it was hardly surprising.\n\nCombine the weak food and poor service with Rock Bottom being too far from home for a night out just to drink, and you get the exact formula that's kept me from going there in the past...and will keep me from going often in the future.","During my recent visit to Rock Bottom, I didn't notice any significant changes since my last visit a year or two ago.

Eventually, we received our cold beers, but only after multiple attempts from both men and women.

Although the bar wasn't too crowded, the bartender seemed to overlook us, as if we were invisible. Unfortunately, this has been a recurring issue at Rock Bottom.

So with my gift certificate I took my brother out for a birthday dinner.  \n\nAs I get older, my tolerance for things like crowds and youngsters gets lower and lower.  As a result, I told my brother to be ready by 4pm so we could head to the Waterfront before everyone goes out for date night.  Plus the Pirates were playing at 4:05 so we could enjoy our beers and the game.\n\nWhen we arrived, the bar side was already pretty packed but we were still able to get a table.

We loved the fact that as she approached our table with a full tray of samples our server said, \""I have to go back for the rest.\""  In all we were served 10 different beers each (in 3 oz glasses, maybe 4 - I can never tell).  I gotta say, Rock Bottom knows their beer.  I liked more than I didn't, and very few were not to my liking.

The spicy ranch was top notch, though.  As we ran out of beer, we each ordered up a Kobe Burger.  They were both cooked exactly to our liking (medium).  And to top off our wonderful evening, the Pirates brought home a win!\n\nMy only complaint, as a beer drinker, is the cost for a growler.  The glass container itself is sold for $12.95.  That's the empty price.  To me, that's a little ridiculous when East End only charges $3 for the bottle and Penn Brewery $5.  Paying more for the bottle than the beer inside seems like insanity to me.  So I walked out empty handed.

This has to be one of the worst dishes I've ever had it was like pancake syrup over breaded chicken. To finish the meal we had the homemade chocolate chip cookies served with hot fudge. Well there was no hot fudge it was chocolate syrup the ice cream was so crystallized from melting and re-freezing all around disappointing.,"I went to the restaurant with my boyfriend and we started off by ordering the crab artichoke dip. Unfortunately, it was very greasy and lacked any notable amount of crab. However, the wedge salad was fresh and delicious. For my main course, I ordered the hazelnut crusted chicken, but it ended up being one of the worst dishes I've ever tasted. It seemed like pancake syrup was poured over the breaded chicken. Lastly, we ordered the homemade chocolate chip cookies with hot fudge. Regrettably, the ""hot fudge"" turned out to be chocolate syrup and the ice cream was not great due to being melted and re-frozen. Overall, it was a disappointing experience.",1,1,0,1
231,"Tom and I decided to try this place out before catching a late movie on a Saturday night. He is a beer buff, and neither of us had ever been there, so we gave it a go.\n\nWe walked in around 8pm and we were told that there would be an hour long wait. We put our names on the list and went shopping around the area. About 25 minutes later, our table was ready. Parking was a cluster since the lot is shared with Dave & Busters and a karaoke bar called Sing Sing. Tom dropped me off at the door so I could secure our table.\n\nOur server, Jackie, approached me almost immediately and brought two waters to the table to start. She was very attentive and funny, and probably the best part of our experience at the restaurant. Tom ordered a Red Ale and to his surprise, didn't care for it. Jackie gave Tom three free samples of beers she thought he would like after talking to him about his beer drinking habits. He loved all three, and chose the most bizarre (and expensive) beer. Jackie switched the Red Ale to the beer of Tom's choice, and charged us for the less expensive beer. Very nice of her!\n\nWe started out with the Ball Park Pretzels with Jalapeno dip. The pretzels came out quickly and they were very fresh, not to mention huge! We only ate one and took the other to go. Very good app though! \n\nTom ordered some sort of bacon cheeseburger, and I got the Chicken Fried Chicken, which was a pounded chicken breast, breaded and fried, over white cheddar mashed potatoes with a side of gravy and some apple coleslaw.  Tom's burger came with a small handful of fries, and my meal was very spread out on my plate, like something was missing. Not very good presentation at all. The food itself was okay, nothing to write home about. The potatoes were my favorite part. Tom said that his burger was mediocre.\n\nAnother note: The bathrooms are shared with the Sing Sing karaoke bar that is in the same building, so expect drunk singing women in the bathrooms and brides-to-be puking in the stall next to you after enjoying too much alcohol at their bachelorette party... Yuck.\n\nOverall, we might come back for the beer and service, but not for the food. And DEFINITELY not to use the bathroom...","Tom and I decided to check out this restaurant before heading to a late movie on a Saturday night. Tom is a beer aficionado and we had never visited before so we thought we'd give it a shot. Upon arriving around 8pm, we were informed that we would have to wait for an hour. We added our names to the list and wandered around the neighborhood. To our surprise, our table was ready just 25 minutes later. The parking area was very crowded as the lot is shared with Dave & Busters and Sing Sing, a karaoke bar. Tom dropped me off at the door so I could reserve our table. 

Our server, Jackie, promptly appeared and provided us two glasses of water to begin. She was extremely attentive and amusing, and was definitely the highlight of our meal experience. Tom requested a Red Ale but was disappointed with it. Jackie suggested three different types of beer for Tom to sample based on his beer preferences. He enjoyed all three and chose the most unusual (i.e., expensive) beer. Since the cost of the Red Ale was less, Jackie replaced it with Tom's preferred beer and only charged us for the cheap beer. Very thoughtful of her! 

Our feast began with enormous Ball Park Pretzels with Jalapeno dip. The pretzels were served promptly, fresh, and were sizeable. We only ate one serving and took the other at home. It was a very good appetizer however! 

Tom ordered a bacon cheeseburger whereas I ordered the Chicken Fried Chicken, a chicken breast pounded, breaded, and fried, over white cheddar mashed potatoes with gravy on the side and an apple coleslaw. Tom's burger featured a few fries while my meal was broadly spread across my plate, looking like something was absent. The presentation was not visually pleasing. The food itself was alright, nothing notable. Among the components, mashed potatoes were my preferred part. According to Tom, his burger was average. 

One more thing: the restrooms are shared with Sing Sing, which is located within the same building. Hence, expect women singing drunkenly in the bathroom and brides-to-be vomiting in the adjacent stall after their bachelorette party. Yuck. 

All things considered, we may revisit for the amazing service and beer, but certainly not for the food. And ESPECIALLY not to use the restrooms...",0,1,1,1

233,"So after an evening of enjoying a comedy show at the Waterfront, we headed to Rock Bottom for some late night grub.  The place was pretty busy, we had to walk around the bar area for several minutes until a nice couple told us they were about to leave and we could have their bar table.  As nice as this was of them it was awkward standing over them as they finished their drinks paid their bill and left.  \n\nSo finally seated I look over the drinks and being the huge IPA lover that I am I went with that and it was indeed a good choice.  The hubby had the Red Ale which was also rather good.\n\nThe service was OK, not the best not the worst.  But moving on to more important thing, the food.  Talk about missing the mark hugely!  I ordered the mini street fish tacos.  You get four mini tacos with a marinated in lime piece of fish, and tomatillo salsa.  They were just strokes away from inedible.  I love fish tacos, I mean it is such a simple concept so why do people have such a hard time executing this dish? The shells were hard and literally split at the bottom when I picked them up.  The sour cream sprayed all over the plate only made them messy and the poor fish was just so overcooked.  If I wasn't so hungry I wouldn't have eaten them at all! Lesson learn on that.\n\nThe husband had the BBQ Chicken Pizza.  It had beans and corn with roasted red pepper on it along with some sour cream.  My husband is usually the type that will order these lovely specialty pizza's and ask for them to remove all the wonderful unique toppings!  For instance, he would usually just say, Chicken BBQ and cheese, nothing else!  I refused to let him do that this time, because I was really intrigued in the combination of ingredients on this pie.  And boy was I jealous when it came out.  It blew my crappy tacos out of the water!  Should have stuck with something simple.  \n\nFurthermore I could care less if I come back to this location.  The beers were good but hell you can get a decent IPA just about anywhere anymore.  And the underwhelming food sealed the deal.

238,"Good food and large portions. I ordered the Veggie Burger for $8.50 and I loved it! It's one of the most unique veggie burgers I have ever had: a homemade patty of beans, rolled oats and veggies. The chipotle mayo really gave it that oomph. My burger was more than enough for me to handle and everything was worth the price. As for drinks, I'm a complete noob when it comes to beer but my friend ordered a tap and even from a small taste, I could tell it was very good quality beer. Bitter and sweet, with a slight tang. I rarely drink beer but i I'm going to, then might as well drink the best kind there is - fresh and microbrewed.\n\nNOTE: There aren't too many options for vegetarians. The veggie burger was pretty good and I'd recommend it, but other than that, there's also the veggie tacos, a few select appetizers, and a few salads from which to choose.","The food here is amazing with generous servings. I opted for the Veggie Burger priced at $8.50 and it did not disappoint! The patty was a unique blend of beans, rolled oats and vegetables made in-house. The chipotle mayo added an extra kick to the burger. I must say that the portion was more than enough for me and definitely worth the price. As for drinks, I'm not much of a beer drinker, however, my friend ordered from the tap and just a sip was enough to clue me in on the quality.

239,"The food is standard American fare--a bit overpriced in my mind--and the beers range from mediocre to very bad.  The K\u00f6lsch is the only decent beer of the bunch.  The service is good, but the wait for food or a table can be quite long (generally 20-30 minutes even for just beer and apps).  I've been to the one at the Denver airport as well, but I was stranded and had free meal tickets, so okay-but-nothing-special pizza from Rock Bottom it was.  Since it's a recognizable national chain, I think of places like this as more of a tourist brewery rather than a true Pittsburgh craft-brew experience.","The food and beer at this establishment are typical of American cuisine, but in my opinion, they are a little overpriced. Of all the beers offered, the K\u00f6lsch stands out as the only decent option.

I have visited a Rock Bottom location at the Denver airport while stranded and, while the pizza was okay, it didn't stand out as anything special.

240,"The beer is good but the food is nothing to brag about at ALL. I've tried many things on the menu, and if you have developed a \""foodie\"" palate, don't even bother, because you will be very disappointed. If you feel comfortable with chain restaurants and their lack of innovative touch (which, nothing wrong with that!) you will most likely enjoy Rockbottom. The only entree I did enjoy were the lobster and shrimp enchiladas (minus the repulsive beans and rice) and the asiago crab dip as an appetizer. Otherwise, you are better off skipping it.","While the beer is decent, the same cannot be said for the food which is quite underwhelming. After trying out several items from their menu, I must say that food enthusiasts might not find anything particularly exciting here. However, if you don't mind the typical and conventional fare that most chain restaurants offer, then Rockbottom could be a good pick for you. Personally, the only dishes that piqued my interest were the lobster and shrimp enchiladas, and asiago crab dip - though I could do without the unappetizing beans and rice.

Some have been amazing, like Jim Breuer, while others have been surprisingly disappointing, like Tracy Morgan. Despite this, the venue itself always provides a great experience. There really isn't a bad seat in the house, and the small size ensures an intimate setting where you can enjoy everything happening on stage. Just be aware that if you sit in the very front, you may be in for a surprise!

Waiting outside in the dead of winter is no fun, and the small lobby means you may have to wait outside until the show starts or ends.

The day the Groupons were purchased, my friend Katrina called & reserved two tickets to Jim Jeffries for 3/30 at 10pm. They allowed her to use her Groupon & gave her a confirmation code & everything! Shortly after, they changed many of the comedians on their website, including Jim Jeffries, to Special Events. When I called I was told I could not use my Groupon. The same thing happened to many of my friends. It's a classic bait & switch. These comedians were NOT Special Events until after the Groupon came out. In addition, other restrictions, such not being able to use the Groupons on Saturdays & having to use the additional four vouchers for one show, were NOT listed under the restrictions when the Groupon was for sale. \n\nSo tonight, my friends & I had pretty much resolved ourselves to the fact that we were not going to the Improv because they wouldn't allow us to use our Groupons.

250,"The place does what it does best - Comedy.  The food, however.  Blah.\n\nFirst off, If you go to a show, please note there is a two item per person minimum.

I learned that one the hard way.  Get water. \n\nThird, before tipping your server, please make sure she hasn't already taken her cut out.  Even after paying for two very bland, overpriced meals and way too many Diet Cokes, I thought that my bill was rather high.  Upon further inspection, I noticed that my server had taken an 18% gratuity.  The menu explicitly says that an automatic gratuity will be taken out for parties of six or more, but there was only two of us and we weren't even drunk.  I found this tactic awfully presumptuous and left her tip at the 18% even though I typically tip well over 20%.    \n\nOverall, I don't like the idea of being required to purchase food just to see a comedy show.  I can see why they do it, but if I were required to buy a crappy popcorn and overpriced pop every time I went to the movies, I would be far less inclined to go as I am not inclined to go to the Improv again.","Although the comedy at this place is top-notch, the food leaves a lot to be desired. Keep in mind that there is a two item minimum per person when attending a show, which includes a selection of pricey drinks and bar food.

Before tipping your server, double-check to ensure they haven't already included a gratuity in your bill, especially if you are not part of a larger group.

The interior is clean; the seats are comfortable; and it's an OK atmosphere to see a show and laugh.\n\nIt's too small, however, to attract many of the best acts, which limits its ability to ever become the central hub for Pittsburgh comedy.  Most of the big names that have recently come through Pittsburgh--Jim Gaffigan, Louis CK, Second City--all perform elsewhere (though they managed to get Bob Saget, to their credit).\n\nBut the biggest problem is the food and drink.  They're very up front about their mandatory two item minimum, but the forced service requires that you spend extra money and get interrupted by waitstaff at least several times during the show.

You're forced to either (a) buy extremely overpriced drinks (3.50 for a soda, for example, with no refills--or ten dollars for one with refills), or (b) buy moderately overpriced food which you wouldn't want in the first place.  I thought the ten dollar chicken sandwich looked reasonable, until a few bites in I decided I'd rather just throw away the money than keep eating it.\n\nStill, I think this place has a lot of potential; the core idea is very workable; and they do attract some really good comedians.  Two stars for now, with high hopes for improvements.\n\nA few specific drawbacks which could be VERY easily fixed:\n1 - A lot of the drinks didn't have prices on them.  I know this isn't uncommon, but at a venue where every question you ask interrupts not only your own show-viewing experience as well as the experiences of your neighbors, it's an incredibly poor decision here.  Make everything on the menu exceptionally clear.  It's not that hard.\n2 - Put the drink prices on the website too.  An Improv representative has personally responded to many of these Yelp reviews, and she once said \""Our menus and pricing are listed on our website, which makes for easy planning!\""  I'm calling shenanigans.  Not all the prices are on the website, which makes for difficult planning.\n3 - Reminding me to tip my server during the show AND adding an automatic gratuity to the check makes me feel like you're trying to trick me.  It's kind of an unprofessional way to say goodbye to one's customers.\n4 - Since the $3.50 soft drinks don't come with free refills, the servers shouldn't ask \""would you like a refill on that?\"" or anything of the sort.  They should ask \""would you like another one?\"" instead.  They should also respond to requests for refills by saying \""we don't offer refills, but I'd be happy to get you another one.\""  Just because there's a 10 dollar refillable soda option on the menu doesn't mean people all figure it out.  Most patrons don't even bother reading the beverage section of the menu if all they want is a standard beverage offered almost everywhere (like a cola or diet cola), and the reading difficulties imposed by the darkness make them even less likely to browse the offerings.","The Pittsburgh Improv has potential to be a great comedy club, but falls short due to a few specific issues. Although the interior is clean and comfortable, its small size limits the acts it can attract. Furthermore, the mandatory two-item minimum, with overpriced and low-quality food and drinks, is a major drawback. Despite these issues, there are ways to improve the experience. By clearly listing all prices and preventing disruptions during shows, the Improv could greatly enhance its customer experience. Additionally, removing automatic gratuity and improving beverage service would help to make customers feel valued. Although the Improv has potential, it currently only earns two stars.",0,1,0,1
252,"I love the Improv. I think its a great way to start or spend a night! Nothing like a laughter filled night. I think its great that we get so many great comedians coming our way (Owen Benjamin, Pablo Francisco super funny Tammy Pescatelli not so much.)\n\nThings you should be aware of: The staff is really strict on the 2 drink minimum so be prepared to spend money on the pricey food and drinks. I kinda wish their menu was a little bit more extensive. Their service is spotty\n\nThe wait staff is a little iffy. I have been here MANY times and sometimes I get an attentive waitress and sometimes not. Most recently our waitress was rude, didn't bother with pleasantries and barely took notice of us. Also beware of the fact they automatically add gratuity. If our waitress was nice I would be more than glad to add to it but this time I was like no way!\n\np.s. when I used my groupon I didn't have any trouble","Expressing my adoration for Improv, I believe it's a fantastic way to kick off or unwind an evening. There's simply nothing quite like a night filled with laughter. It's wonderful to see so many great comedians make their way to our venue, with some being incredibly hilarious like Owen Benjamin and Pablo Francisco. However, some others lack the same impact, like Tammy Pescatelli.

A couple of aspects one should be mindful of while here would be their strict policy on the 2 drink minimum, which can add up to a substantial expense. It would have been nicer if their menu was slightly more diverse, but the options they provide are decent. The service they provide is not consistent, and the waitstaff can be unpredictable, sometimes being exceptionally attentive, while on other occasions they are neglectful. Our most recent experience had us dealing with an impolite waitress, who disregarded basic courtesies and barely paid us any attention. In addition, keep in mind that they automatically add gratuity, which is typically based on their service levels. If the service was top-notch, I would happily augment the gratuity; however, unfortunately not this time.

P.S.: When I used my Groupon at Improv, I didn't experience any trouble whatsoever!",1,1,0,1
253,"My husband and I went to do something fun. The comedy was great!  The food, however, is mediocre at best. In addition, we were seated in the last row, and 10 minutes into the headliner they sat someone else at our table, so that they were in front of us. I could not see a thing. When we received our check, they had added an 18% gratuity without permission or notification.  I will not be returning anytime soon.","My spouse and I decided to have a fun night out. Although the comedy show was fantastic, the food was not up to par. Furthermore, we were seated at the back of the room and, halfway through the show, they seated another group at our table, obstructing our view.

254,"We came to the Improv for the first time on Friday night for my wife's work holiday party. We arrived early for dinner and drinks from a predetermined menu. Dinner started with a salad of clearly bagged, almost brown iceberg lettuce, with some croutons and frozen-then-thawed looking tomatoes that were pinkish at best. I took a few bites of this unappetizing poor excuse for a salad, and I can tell you it was downright tragic. Dinner arrived and since there wasn't any vegetarian options on this predetermined menu, we received a dish that was supposed to contain meat with the meat omitted. It was a huge pile of spaghetti in a bowl. It looked sloppy and tasted worse than it looked. The pasta was overcooked, and the tomato sauce was just watered down pur\u00e9ed canned tomatoes. I saw traces of onion in my dish but didn't taste them at all. I was so hungry that I salted the heck out of this abomination and took a few bites. Yuck. I didn't make a dent in this crapfest. For dessert we were given a choice of chocolate cake, which my wife ordered, and cheesecake, which I ordered. The chocolate cake had freezer burn. Inexcusable! It wasn't edible. The cheesecake was only a hair better, but it had obviously come out of the freezer as well. I know people aren't coming here for the food, but if you are FORCING them to order things off of your menu to fulfill some outdated requirements (two drink/two menu item minimum) then at least make some halfway decent food. It doesn't even have to be memorable...just not OFFENSIVE. Which it was!! Had I paid for any of this I would have made a huge stink, but I tried to be polite and push my food around and make small talk. \n\nThe comedians were good. The venue was nice-ish and we got to sit in the front because we arrived early for our \""event\"". Not always the best thing in a comedy club (we only got picked on a little bit). But damn, I was hungry! I found myself fantasizing about all of the crappy Waterfront restaurants and how I'd rather be there...how I'd rather be heating up a discount microwave dinner...how I'd rather have a giant bowl of Captain Crunch...how I'd rather go back in time and eat spaghetti from my high school cafeteria...what a dreadful dining experience.\n\nMy car was also violated in the parking lot. I had an adorable German license plate on the front of my adorable German car which was stolen while I was eating hideous food, which was just the slap in the face I wanted when finally retreating to my car. I feel sick in so many different ways about this experience as a whole.\n\nThe Improv should consider outsourcing the food prep to a catering company. I truly believe that's the only thing that can save this place. Do yourself a favor and eat beforehand, and just order a beer. Well, two I guess. Other diners at our table complained about the quality of the cocktails so I'd steer clear of those. Unless there is a can't miss type of comedian here, I can't ever picture going back to the Improv. I'd give the comedians 4 stars, and the food ZERO stars.","My wife's company holiday party was at the Improv on Friday night, and it was our first time there. We arrived early for dinner and drinks, which were pre-selected from a set menu. The salad was disappointing, with iceberg lettuce that looked like it had come from a bag, and stale-looking croutons and tomatoes. It wasn't appetizing at all. The main course was supposed to be a meat-based dish, but since we're vegetarians, we were given a bowl of pasta instead. Sadly, it was overcooked and tasted bland. Even after adding salt, it wasn't edible. For dessert, we chose chocolate cake and cheesecake, but both had clearly been in the freezer for too long. They were practically inedible. 

Despite the food being terrible, the comedians were good, and we enjoyed sitting in the front row. If you're going to the Improv, I'd suggest eating beforehand and just ordering a drink. Other diners at our table complained about the quality of the cocktails, so I'd stay away from those too. Unless you're seeing a really good comedian, I wouldn't recommend going. Overall, it was a disappointing experience, and I hope the Improv will consider getting a catering company to help with their food.",1,1,0,1

257,I love that we have a great comedy club in Pittsburgh with a great location at the Waterfront.  Perfect for a date night and I recommend going to a later show and grabbing dinner beforehand.  I received an online coupon code for $5 tickets for John Heffron. What a deal-def. check for deals before you pay full price for any shows here.  We went early to pick up the tickets at the ticket office.  People were lined up outside about an hour before the show and it was freezing out.  I had no interest in doing this so we grabbed a beer across the street at Rock Bottom. Once they opened the doors (15 minutes before show time) the line went quickly and even though we were at the end we still got seated at a table in the back.  It is not huge inside so there aren't really any bad seats.  They usually have an MC for the night who starts  warming up the crowd. This guy was funny and so was the opening act before John Heffron.  My only complaint about this place is that they have a two drink minimum and the prices are outrageous.  $9.50 for a mixed well drink and $7 for draft beers.  The soda was $3.50! Yikes!  At least we didn't pay full price for the tickets.,"Pittsburgh boasts of an amazing comedy club located at the Waterfront that is perfect for a romantic night out. Catching a later show and having dinner beforehand is highly recommended. Always check for coupons and discounts to save a few bucks. We arrived at the ticket office early but didn't have to brave the freezing outdoors as we chose to grab a beer at Rock Bottom instead. Although we were at the end of the line, we still managed to secure a table in the back since the club is not very big. The MC and opening acts were hilarious before John Heffron took the stage. My only gripe is the exorbitant prices for beverages as the club has a two drink minimum. However, with the discounted tickets, it was still a good deal.",1,1,0,1
258,"I went here for the first time the other night and had a great time!  The comedian was hilarious and it was a great intimate setting for a fun night out with friends!

While Barnes & Noble does offer audio and video selections, the prices are not necessarily the best deals. In fact, many movies can be purchased online for less, albeit with a waiting period. However, I have found great discounts on select books, particularly cookbooks and mysteries, for under $5. 

All things considered, Barnes & Noble is more of a social gathering spot with books available for immediate purchase. While the prices may not always be the most competitive, it can still offer a pleasant browsing experience. However, for specific items, I tend to prefer online shopping for convenience and better deals.",0,1,0,1

276,"I stopped here yesterday with Rob and Matt after golf to have a few drinks prior to seeing \""The Hangover\"" at Loews across the street.  Incidentally, \""The Hangover\"" is one of the funniest movies I've seen in years and worth the $10 to see it in the theater.  Okay, back to the restaurant the space itself is very nice.  There are plenty of hightops, plasmas and a few booths.  It's spacious and they have outdoor seating and open windows.  We sat at the bar and were greeted relatively quickly by the bartender who was tending a pretty much empty bar.  I ordered a guinness as usual, Rob ordered a long island iced tea and Matt had a miller light.  Make sure and tell them if you want a top shelf tea else you'll be getting the stuff in the plastic bottles.  I sampled Rob's long island tea and it was not that good way too much sours.  The next one he ordered was much better after a little guidance to the bartender.  The bartender herself was okay, not too friendly but quick enough with the pours.  I don't remember her name which is usually not a good sign.  We ordered a few things from the appetizer menu.  We started with the chips and salsa.  The chips were crisp enough, but not served warm and the salsa had some spice but the colors were a little off kind of looked like the color of pea soup.  Rob then ordered the philly cheese steak sliders.  I tried one it was okay I guess  the bun was warm and it was pretty loaded with cheese and onions.  He asked for a side of mayo and they said they were out, which is bizarre because there is a giant eagle a couple blocks away.  This pretty much sums up my experiences at the Bar Louie's I've been too.  They kind of do just enough for me to come back but rarely make any real effort with service.  Maybe I'm being too critical... I tried to order the baked goat cheese, but they were out... So, I settled on the hummus appetizer.  This was surprisingly pretty good.  The pita was warm and toasted the hummus had lots of flavor and the tabouleh was edible.  It's probably best to stick to simple stuff when dining here.  Matt had the hot wings which I tried one and it was okay, your pretty standard mass produced chicken wing.  All in all this place isn't that bad.  If you want to grab a drink before or after the movie and you're more concerned with convenience than necessarily friendly service and really good food than you could do worse.","Yesterday after playing golf with Rob and Matt, we stopped at this restaurant before heading across the street to watch ""The Hangover"" at Loews. By the way, the movie is hilarious and definitely worth the money to watch it in the cinema. The restaurant itself is spacious with a lot of high tables, booths, TVs, and outdoor seating. We sat at the bar and the bartender quickly attended to our order. I had my usual Guinness, Rob ordered a Long Island iced tea, and Matt got a Miller Lite. If you prefer a higher quality tea, let the bartender know. Rob's first Long Island was too sour, but the second one was much better with some help from the bartender. The bartender wasn't very friendly, but she was fast with her work. We ordered some appetizers from the menu, starting with chips and salsa. The chips were crispy enough, but the salsa's color looked like pea soup. Rob ordered Philly cheese steak sliders, which were okay, but he didn't get the side of mayo he asked for. This seems like a recurring theme at other Bar Louie's restaurants as well. They don't try hard enough to provide excellent service, but the simple things on the menu are decent enough. I settled on hummus since they were out of baked goat cheese. It was surprisingly good with warm pita and flavorsome hummus. Matt had standard mass-produced hot wings which were okay. Overall, Bar Louie's isn't a bad place. If you're looking for convenience more than good food and excellent service, it's a decent spot to grab a drink before or after a movie.",0,1,0,1

She says she didn't even realize our food hadn't arrived (well, you never even checked on us, so of course you didn't).

We shovelled what we could into our mouths, did NOT leave a tip (thankfully, we didn't have the added gratuity that John had), and sprinted to our movie where we covertly finished our smuggled food. Worst part? I opened the wetnap, and it was totally dry. Of course.\n\nHowever, I gave this place two stars instead of one. That's because my food, when I finally got it, was perfect. I had the Greek burger and it was huge, cooked exactly how I like it, with delicious toppings. I really wish I could come back here for the food but...hell no.","Similar Text:

Like John R., my experience at this restaurant was far from satisfactory. We arrived with plenty of time to spare before our movie but were unfortunately let down by the extremely slow service. Despite the restaurant being practically empty and having three waitresses, it took a lengthy 15 minutes just to receive our drinks order. As we hadn't had any food yet this gave me a sense of trepidation, however, we decided to make our orders regardless.

After waiting for another 20 minutes, we flagged over our waiter to inquire about our food as we had only 45 minutes before our movie was due to start. Our waitress reassured us that our food would be with us shortly, but another 20 minutes passed and still, there was no sign of our meals. Frustrated, we tried to find our waitress but she was nowhere to be found. We enlisted the help of another waitress who managed to track down our original waitress chatting idly with another colleague.

When she finally made it over to our table, she explained that she hadn't realized our food had not yet arrived and that our order had mistakenly gone to someone else. We were offered a take-out but we were already starving and reluctantly agreed. To add insult to injury, the only complimentary thing we received was the iced tea while our food arrived cold and with an added bill. Disappointingly, we decided not to leave a tip and quickly fled to the cinema, secretly finishing our meals midway through the movie.

Despite the terrible service, I still managed to rate the restaurant two out of five stars, solely due to the taste and quality of my Greek burger. However, despite the good taste, I cannot see myself making a return visit anytime soon.",1,1,1,1

To me, that is Bar Louie\n\nI can't say the food is bad. I had an order of the pretzel sticks for an appetizer and the cinnamon sauce tasted like water and the pretzels were stale. I will say I still ate them so shame on me. My  sandwich (the Mario) as always was very good.\n\nNow here comes the bad:\n\n1. There were fruit flies EVERYWHERE. I felt like we were eating on top of a garbage dump. At one point I had to get a new drink because one flew in my beer.

However, our experience at this location was extremely disappointing. We visited on a Friday night before a show at the Improv, hoping to catch up with friends over some cocktails and a quick meal. Unfortunately, we never got the chance to order food due to the poor service. We arrived at around 6:45 pm, and even though the bar wasn't even 75% full, we still had to wait for a server for at least 5-7 minutes. We finally received our drinks at 7:04 pm, and by that time, Happy Hour had ended, and we missed out on the discounted pricing. The server was pleasant and apologized for the delay, but it was clear that the bar was severely understaffed. They only had two bartenders and not enough cocktail servers, which led to a long wait time for drinks.

I've eaten here and stopped in for drinks a couple times over the years and I just haven't been super impressed by the place.\n\nThe food has been decent - a few years back I splurged on an enormous fried chicken sandwich and definitely enjoyed it, glutton that I am - but their meals and appetizers alike have admittedly never \""wowed\"" me. And while I enjoy their cocktails and would consider stopping in just for drinks more often, the problem is that things are way overpriced here. Even during the happy hour drinks are pretty costly, not to mention that I think most of the drinks I personally like don't qualify for the happy hour discount, which is disappointing. Once I stopped in with friends after a movie and one drink cost me $10 here. Not even a large one, either! Sorry, but I find that to be kind of ridiculous, especially since there's cheaper places to get drinks in the area.\n\nStill, the food and drinks are definitely a-ok albeit overpriced, so this place would be rated 3 stars in my mind IF I could hear myself think when I eat here. But good Lord, they're just so loud! I always leave with a sore throat from yelling to make myself heard. Not cool, Bar Louie. Not cool.\n\nSo while the food and drinks are fine enough the loud venue and prices mean that this is definitely not one of my favorite places - and given the other options we have at the Waterfront I don't expect to be back in any time soon.","I have been to Bar Louie a few times over the years, but it just doesn't impress me enough to become a regular. The food is decent, although nothing has ever really blown me away.

307,"Sandcastle is a mixed bag for the kiddos.  On the one hand, there are plenty of waterslides/pools that are a good fit for young \""riders\"", on the other hand, Sandcastle, like any city amusement park, attracts more than its fair share of highschool kids looking to spend some time away from their parents and assert their personhood.  \n\nUnfortunately that element doesn't particularly care about \""censoring\"" speech for 9 year old ears, and worse, in the Mon Tsunami, about personal space, since the wave pool becomes a near mosh pit of jostling and strutting and shoving and 'showing off' for the fairer sex, and that can be a little dicey for the littler kids.\n\nHaving said that, it's still a good day at the park. . . cheese fries, a cool dip in the pool on a hot day, some fun slides. . . \n\nI think in rating Sandcastle fairly you have to understand the context of the park.

Although there are many suitable water slides and pools for young children to enjoy, the amusement park can also attract high school students seeking independence from their parents. This group of teenagers may use inappropriate language and engage in rough behavior, which could be intimidating for smaller children. Despite these negative aspects, the park can still be enjoyable with options like cheesy fries and refreshing pool dips.  However, it is important to recognize that Sandcastle can be an unmonitored environment, and parents must remain attentive to their surroundings, especially when in close proximity to rowdy teenagers. Generally, Sandcastle offers a positive experience for visitors, but there are a few things to keep in mind for a safe and fun day.",1,1,0,1
308,"So the last time I went to a water park was probably when I was in elementary school and didn't really know how to swim (... I still kinda don't. lol). Anyway, it was in California at Raging Rivers and it was a traumatizing experience. Screaming & being tossed around in the pool that pushes periodic waves at the sound of a loud horn and ending up with scraped knees and feet. Not fun.\n\nSo to say the least, I was a bit nervous coming to this water park afraid to have another episode of feeling I was being drowned. Luckily that did not happen.\n\nI seriously had SO MUCH fun here! I honestly was only expecting to go on the Lazy River pool all day but with my bf, we hit up so many rides... tandem AND single rides! I feel like such a big girl now! Definitely lean back while you're on those single donuts on the water rides, or else you feel like you're going to flip over while swishing down the tubes. The new dragon ride they just opened up was okay. I was expecting it to be so much more fun, but literally you just slide down a dark tube into a circular room where you just slowly swirl your way down the middle hole and that was it. \n\nThere was this one ride where you slide down the tubes for a few seconds, then you land into a pool where a worker pushes you into another tube and this continues about 3 times. It was weird. Kinda awkward with the worker having to grab you and push you through. Although it was still fun. The last dude threw me in backwards! Scared the crap out of me but it was fun :)\n\nThe food here is surprisingly pretty affordable. Plus, who wants to eat a huge meal while in your swim suit. Me don't want no pot belly. \n\nOverall I had such a fun time here. It definitely made me rethink my fear of water parks. By the way, we went on a Saturday in early June and it wasn't as packed as I thought it would be! So the lines weren't long at all. Also, go to Giant Eagle to purchase your discounted tickets. You save a few bucks versus buying them at the water park. Oh and don't forget to bring sandals while walking around. Your feet will literally feel like they're burning from the ground. Now go off and have some fun! :)","My last visit to a water park was a bad experience because I was unable to swim well and the place had rough waves that resulted in me getting scraped knees and feet. That traumatic incident made me anxious about going to another water park. However, I had a pleasant surprise on this trip with my boyfriend. We tried a bunch of rides that I thought I would never have the courage to go on, including single donut-like rides where you need to lean back to avoid flipping over. The food was also affordable, and I refrained from eating a lot to avoid a pot belly in my swimsuit. In contrast to my earlier experience, I had such a great time at the park that it dispelled my deep-seated apprehensions about water parks. On a related note, we got discounted tickets at Giant Eagle, and it was great not to have to wait in long lines. It would also be wise to bring sandals to avoid burning feet while walking around.

309,"okay, so it's not as fun as kennywood but i guess it's still cool... \n\ni planned ahead a day to go for me & bobby (his first time) it was supposed to be nice day, but the weather changed in 2 weeks.. \n\nwe picked a nice time.. since it was literally supposed to rain all day, there werent any long lines/ we literally rode every water slide in one hour. then we went to head to the lazy river--- & it was closed! they said it was closed due to not enough attendence, but i mean come on. we still paid $70 for 2 people to come in this park where i just rode everything in one hour.. keep the lazy river open so i can kill an hour! aah. the cliff hanger was also closed- like always. \n\nso we just went and rode everything again. the Dragon's Den is sweet and the blue tubaluba is as well. bobby had a blast on the speed slides. i have to admit though, i do miss the regular body slide. \n\nanother reason i chose august 3rd to go to sandcastle was that the park was open until 7pm rather than 5 or 6 like regular days. well actually at 4:45 we recieved a \""15 minute warning\"" that the park was closing at 5 due to rain. ugh, a little more time would've been helpful. \n\ni couldnt hear the warning and asked an employee who said they were closing in ten minutes due to the weather and being under-staffed to stay open until 7. it started to rain at 5 and literally at 5:20 the rain was over . the park could've just shut down the rides until the rain cloud passed,  but due to being under-staffed would rather hand out rain checks.. which is fine because we get an another entire day, but i mean it would be a terrible inconvience from someone out of town who planned a family day. \n\noverall, the smile on my boyfriend's face was priceless, but i truly wish we could've enjoyed the lazy river and the park until 7. hopefully next time things go as planned....","While not as thrilling as Kennywood, Sandcastle still had its own charm. I had planned a day ahead to go with my friend Bobby, hoping for good weather. Unfortunately, the forecast changed drastically in just two weeks of time. 

Despite the rain, we managed to enjoy ourselves because the water park wasn't crowded at all. We rode every water slide within an hour, but were disappointed to find the lazy river closed. We paid good money for the park, and not having everything available was tough to swallow. They said it was due to not enough attendance, but after spending $70 for two people, it was hard to accept. 

Instead, we ended up redoing the slides and found that the Dragon's Den and blue Tubaluba were fantastic. Bobby loved the speed slides, and while I enjoyed them too, I kind of missed the regular body slides. 

Another reason we chose August 3rd to visit Sandcastle was because the park was open until 7pm. We were given a 15-minute warning at 4:45pm that the park was closing early because of the rain, which was frustrating because it had stopped raining by 5:20pm. It seemed like they could've just closed the rides until the rain had passed, but instead they chose to hand out rain checks due to being understaffed. 

Despite our disappointments, my boyfriend's smile made the day worth it. Hopefully next time, the weather and park schedules will align perfectly.",1,1,0,1
310,"Sandcastle Water Park in P-Burgh was just \""okay\"" for me.

The pool is very small, similar to one you'd find at a hotel chain. It has a hot tub area but it sits about 8 adults max. and people were fighting tooth and nail to get in. It wasn't too impressive to me. \n\nThey also have a lazy river at this park and, while I do enjoy lazy rivers, this one was so packed that it was hard to breathe.

It seems like it's better suited for children rather than adults or families, as there isn't much to do after the age of 16. The water slides were limited, and most of them weren't very exciting. They definitely need to invest in some modern upgrades like a tornado slide. \n\nThey do have a designated adult area with a pool and bar, but it was so overcrowded that it didn't enhance the experience. The pool was small like a typical hotel pool and the hot tub area was only big enough for 8 people. I wasn't impressed. \n\nTheir lazy river ride was way too crowded, which made it difficult to enjoy. There were people constantly bumping into me and it was pretty unpleasant. \n\nThe wave pool was the one attraction that I actually liked.

The turkey burger I ordered with pickle and mustard came with only lettuce, and the loaded mashed potatoes were not what I was expecting at all.

The mixture of ingredients just sliding down your chin as it bubbles out of your mouth. That being said, I really don't understand why people go to Pizzeria Uno. This chain has done to the deep dish pizza what McDonald's has done to hamburgers, Pizza Hut has done to pan pizza, Dominoes has done to hand tossed pizza, and Taco Bell has done to Tex-Mex; it has made it almost unpalatable. On our menu:\n\nFrench onion\nChicken bites\nPizza with pepperoni, hamburger, and romano\n\nLooking past the fact that the service was not the best or the fact that the food came out undercooked and tepid in temperature, the food just was not good.

This chain has taken the quintessential deep dish pizza and turned it into a tasteless dish, comparable to what McDonald's has done to hamburgers or Pizza Hut has done to pan pizza. Even though they offer options like French onion, chicken bites, and a pizza topped with pepperoni, hamburger, and romano, I found myself ignoring how terrible the service was or how the food was cold and undercooked because the taste was simply not worth it. I wouldn't say that it's the worst pizza I've ever had, but it's a prime example of what happens when an exceptional piece of food art is subjected to overthinking and loses its charm.

Sure, it isn't a world class dining establishment, but it is decent considering it is a chain.  You should know that going into any chain, really.  It was basically exactly what I expected in terms of food quality and price.\n\nWe were greeted immediately upon entering, and while the hostess went to grab menus, another server asked us if we were taken care of.

I ordered soup and two appetizers instead of an entree or pizza and the server made sure to ask me about the order in which I would prefer receiving my food.  \n\nMy fiance ordered a deep dish pizza and we know they take longer to make than other food items.  It was quicker than we thought it would be and he really enjoyed it.  I had the potato skin appetizer.

It was delicious, especially with the addition of a little bit of hot sauce.\n\nOverall, it doesn't even come close to visiting an Uno's in Chicago, but then again, when does a copy every live up to the original?  It won't be a regular location in our  dining rotation, but it is good to know that when we have a craving for deep dish, Uno will do the trick and cost a lot less than a trip to Chicago.","I dined at this restaurant on a Saturday night around 8:00 pm. After reading some of the reviews, I wondered if they had gone to the same restaurant I did. I wouldn't say it's the best dining place in the world, but it's decent for a chain restaurant. As with any chain, it's important to have realistic expectations. The food quality and price were exactly what I anticipated. 

As soon as we arrived, we were greeted by the hostess who went to get our menus, while another server checked in to see if we needed help. During our meal, the service was excellent, with regular water and beverage refills. Instead of a big pizza or an entree, I ordered soup and two appetizers, and the server double-checked the order to ensure I received it in the order I preferred. 

My fiance ordered the deep dish pizza, which typically takes longer to prepare than other dishes. However, we were pleasantly surprised at how quickly it was ready, and he thoroughly enjoyed consuming it. I went for the potato skin appetizer, which reminded me of a ""baked potato pizza"" at a local spot back in Buffalo that I used to love. With a little bit of hot sauce, it tasted great.

In general, it's not on par with the original Uno's in Chicago, but then again, when has a knockoff ever been as good as the real thing?

Which I stated right off the bat, that I didn't blame the girl who took my order. I know cooks can't read. I was one for many years. Mistakes happen, and the manger took care of it and took the item off my bill. NO complaints, still ate the food and it was good. Just not a fan of onions on my pizza. \n\nNow onto the bill, the server continues to tell me that she was sorry for the mistake and declares she told the cooks not to add onions. I already said it was taking care of and there's no worries. She goes on to say that the next day was her birthday, and if I felt like leaving all my money as a tip, it wouldn't go unnoticed. I took this as a joke as I had told her earlier I worked in the industry. When I hand over the gift card I had on hand, she comes back and again repeats herself, tells me that cash as a tip is preferred as she doesn't have to claim it at the end of the night. And again if I felt like leaving her all my money, she would just be so freaking happy. Let me explain one thing and hopefully I am very clear on it. No server, and I mean NO server anywhere, should ever ask a guest or customer for a tip, yet alone, do it twice! So out of kindness, which I shouldn't have left anything by this point. I left a nice tip for the cost of what food I did  have to pay for.\n\nBottom line, the food was good for the price, but the service from this one person as I don't know how the rest of the servers are. Was just horrible.","At first, things went smoothly during my visit. I was promptly seated and given a great selection of PA Craft beers to choose from.

However, the manager was helpful and removed the unwanted item from my bill. Though I wasn't pleased with the onions on my pizza, it was still tasty. \n\nAs for my experience with the waitress, things took a turn for the worse. While apologizing for the error, she repeatedly mentioned that the next day was her birthday and if I felt so inclined, leaving her a large tip would be appreciated. While I know wait staff rely on tips for their livelihood, it's not appropriate to ask for a tip from a guest. When I paid with a gift card, she again asked for cash instead, making me uncomfortable.

My salad came out pretty quick which was nice but it had a little too much dressing on it. I didn't complain, it still tasted great.\n\nI'm not into red meat so I tried to order a black bean burger or get chicken instead of beef, but the ran out of black bean and they couldn't get the chicken so i just ordered it anyway. The burger was piled really high with all the toppings including guacamole and it was very creamy but i couldn't get over the taste of the burger because it just didn't have any flavor. Very saddening. I ended up just eating the veggies and discarding the meat. I snacked on some of my hubbies pizza even though it was only a small amount. \n\nWe came here twice in one week. The second time we ordered the 9-grain deep dish with mushrooms, parmesan and a garlic white sauce. Was this pizza amazing or what??

I know what you're supposed to do. I know the ways I've displayed exemplary service and I know the ways I've slacked off. I get it, I really do.\n\nSo I'm in the store early. Hardly any people in there. Weird for the Semi-Annual Sale time of year. Usually it doesn't matter what time you're there during the sale, it's always busy. \n\nI went through my usual bins and picked up a mess of undies and bras. Since no one was at the check out counter and I needed a spot to go through things, I set them down and started to try and chat with the sales chick. I actually always like to do this, just to shoot the breeze, but also to get their opinions on items I'm buying. \n\nThe girl behind the counter was having non of this though.I asked her about a bra and she said she didn't know about that one, but said it should work. I understand, you can't try them all. But the thing that really irked me was that she was definitely not hiding her annoyance at me setting down my things on the counter. I even looked back to make sure there were no people checking out behind me. Ghost town. Tumbleweed rolled by. No one.\n\nSo I'm going through my stuff and separating what I want and don't want and she's sighing and grabbing things saying \""Soooo, you DON'T want these???\"" Um, I'm not asking you to help me sort things. I'm not holding up a line. I'm just trying to not spend $$$ on an accidental XS pair of undies that got mixed in! \n\nAfter that, it's not exactly what she said, but how she acted. I have never felt more uncomfortable in a retail store before. I ended up grabbing my discards and putting them back myself (which I really don't mind doing, but after she huffed and puffed, I didn't even want to deal with her). \n\nThe thing is, I was nice the entire time. I don't expect you to sit there and be sugary sweet either. Just do what you were hired to do. Be nice and sell some bras.

Suck it up and do your job or work where you don't have to talk to anyone else ever.","The reviews for this store are not great, and my recent experience has added to their negative reputation. Despite the fact that I usually avoid reviewing chain retail stores, I feel that I need to let others know about the horrible service I received today. 

I am a retail worker myself, and I know what is expected of customer service. When I walked into the store, there were very few customers around. This was odd for the Semi-Annual Sale time of year, as it's usually packed with people. I picked up a bunch of underwear and bras and set them down at the checkout counter so I could look through them.

The salesperson behind the counter showed no interest in conversing with me, even when I started asking her questions about the items I was purchasing. She seemed very annoyed that I had set my things down on the counter, even though there was nobody else in line. 

As I continued to sort through my things, the saleswoman continued to sigh and make passive-aggressive remarks. It was clear that she was not in a good mood and didn't want to be there. After feeling incredibly uncomfortable being there, I ended up putting my discards back myself and leaving the store.

My expectation of customer service is not to have overly-sweet interactions, but rather a polite and efficient experience. If someone comes to work with a bad attitude, they will only make the situation worse.

I found it rude especially since  there wasn't even a line at this point.  \n\nI think we will travel elsewhere following a movie.  The result never quite met the anticipation.","The food was the only redeeming factor, given a 2.5 rating. We arrived at 8pm on a Saturday, expecting an hour wait, but were seated in just 30 minutes. Although the lettuce wraps were underwhelming, the Dynamite shrimp were plump and delicious with a small spicy kick. However, the Singapore rice noodles were just okay and the fried rice and vegetables were disappointing. Our waiter was annoying and seemed to be rushing us out, constantly asking to clear our plates. Overall, we were left unimpressed and will likely try a different restaurant after a movie next time.",1,1,0,1

346,"Sadly I've been here a few times because it's a crowd pleaser when my girlfriend's parents come down to visit. There's nothing really WRONG with it. The portions are big and the food is \""alright\"" and the interior gives you the superficial impression that you're encountering fine dining.\n\nThe food is sooooo bland though. Everything you get at P.F. Chang's you can get elsewhere in Pittsburgh at a much lower cost and it'll be made with more precision and have better flavor. The honey chicken at P.F. Chang's was so mediocre all I could think about while eating it was heading over to Wai Wai in Bloomfield and getting a tastier order of it for 8 bucks.\n\nLast time we were there the server was horrendous as well. I don't think I've ever felt as awkward at a restaurant. He brought my girlfriend's father (Don) his unsweetened tea then told him he didn't bring sugar because he asked for it sweetened and then did not understand the concept of sweetening it yourself. He then got all huffy when Don kept asking for it and actually seemed angry at us. When he came back to take our order Don ordered for himself and his wife and before Janey (my girlfriend) and I could order he had already started to walk away. We actually had to yell out to get him to come back and finish our order. (not in an uncivilized or malicious way, either) After that he must have thought we were terrible diners (I don't think I've ever been impolite to someone who is currently at work, or ANYONE for that matter) and he showed it by being silent and plopping things down in a passive aggressive way. It was really embarrassing and every time he came by the conversation died.\n\nObviously the attitude of one idiot who can't hide his bad day well doesn't really have anything to do with the restaurant. But it's soooooo bland! Go somewhere else for Chinese! Look up Chinese on Urbanspoon and it'll give you a variety of good, local places to choose from at half the price.","I've been to this restaurant a few times with my girlfriend's parents when they visit, but it's not my top choice. The food portions are generous and the decor makes it seem like fine dining, but the flavors are lacking. You can easily find the same dishes elsewhere in Pittsburgh for a lower price and better taste. For example, I recently had honey chicken at Wai Wai for only $8 and it was much more satisfying than the one at P.F. Chang's. On top of that, our last server was not great. He got upset when my girlfriend's father asked for sugar in his unsweetened tea and showed passive-aggressive behavior throughout the meal. Ultimately, if you're looking for truly delicious Chinese food, I recommend looking up local spots on Urbanspoon instead of settling for bland options.",1,1,0,1

348,"I've had PF Changs both in Pgh and KC and honestly, I'm never been disappointed nor elated with the food. It's 'upscale' Ameri-Chinese food.

We sampled everything from the the Szechuan shrimp to the Mongolian beef to the Dan Dan Noodles.

Do I truly comprehend what constitutes ""authentic"" Chinese food? Maybe to some extent. But for now, I'll continue to put quotes around that term. 

We arrived at this PF Changs on Homestead Waterfront with only 45 minutes left before closing time, and were promptly seated and served by the staff. Although he did forget our order of asparagus, our server was still friendly and efficient.

Chang's a try. \n\nWe came on a Saturday night without reservations, so we had to wait 45min :( Luckily time went by fast while I was on my phone looking at the Yelp reviews for this place. When we were seated, we ordered immediately and our server was very friendly. We got the salt and pepper calamari as an appetizer and then the Dan Dan noodles and Shanghai shrimp with garlic sauce. The food came out quick which was a huge plus considering how busy they were. The calamari was okay. I felt like the strips were cut too thin and we should have received more. The Dan Dan noodles were actually very delicious and flavorful. I really enjoyed them and definitely recommend them. The shrimp was cooked well and was also good.

355,"I have mixed feelings about this place. I wish I could give 2.5 stars, but I'm in a good mood so I'm rounding up today. \n\nThis was my first time here and I honestly wasn't sure what to expect. The first thing I noticed when I walked in was the layout of the dining area. It seemed less intimate than I had pictured in my mind. The tables were all jammed together and the restaurant had a crowded feel to it. Fortunately, there wasn't a long wait as we had made a reservation. \n\nWe were seated at a table in the middle of the dining room alongside a busy throughway. It seemed all the servers were destined to walk past our table. I appreciated that their menu pointed out that their meals were \""meant to be shared.\"" My wife and I decided to share our two meals: Chang's Spicy Chicken and Double Pan Fried Noodles. Before our meal came out our waitress set some sauces on the table in a \""here's your sauce\"" kind of way. I remember thinking, \""That's very nice, but I have no idea why you just gave us sauce.\"" There was no explanation - just a little tray of sauces. Our food came out and she finally asked if we like mild, medium, or hot sauce. We picked medium and, with a few scoops, she turned our three sauces into three mixed sauces and I still didn't know what they were for. \n\nForget the sauce though, my attention was now drawn to our meal. For meals that were \""meant to be shared\"" these sure are little portions. I guess when you go for that high-end presentation you can charge 50% more for 50% less. The food itself was good (in an ok sort of way). I can't say it was the best I've had, but it was good enough. \n\nOverall I thought the experience was lacking. P.F. Chang's tries to be classy, but does it in a cafeteria sort of way. I was constantly distracted by the front doors opening and icy air pouring across the room. The music didn't fit the ambiance.

I appreciated that the menu highlighted that the meals were meant for sharing, so my wife and I decided to order two meals. The waitress placed some sauces on our table without any explanation, which was confusing. The food was served in small portions, which I thought was not suitable, given the prices they charged. While it tasted alright, it was nothing special. The restaurant had a cafeteria vibe, and I was easily distracted by the noise and the constant opening of the front doors, which brought in cold air.

367,"Let me start off by saying I have mostly simple tastes, and my favorite lunch spot for Chinese has been the New Dumpling House in Squirrel Hill. But since that restaurant is undergoing renovations, I was forced to try something new.\n\nSo... I thought I'd try the chain PF Chang's Chinese Restaurant at the Waterfront. Wow, what an unsatisfying mistake that turned out to be.\n\nI started with a cup of their Wonton soup. At $2.95 it wasn't too outrageous of a price, the broth had some flavor and there was much more in it than I was used to, including three giant basil (I think?) leafs that covered everything beneath. In the broth were chunks of chicken, two shrimp, some sliced water chestnuts and two \""pork\""-filled wontons. As I said, the broth had decent flavor, but the wontons were thick, doughy and under-cooked, and the chicken chunks were dry, which is amazing since they were drowned in broth! On a scale of bad to good, it was kind of meh.\n\nNext came my \""lunch-portion\"" order of Chang's Kung Pao Chicken (the dinner portion is $5 more). \n\nAt the New Dumpling House, this dish is served with a delectable dark, rich, tangy sauce, which I was really hoping for... Not at PF Chang's. \n\nOn my plate I received about 8 quarter-size chunks of lightly breaded and browned chicken, 7 hot Chinese red chili peppers (mostly inedible unless they are diced into a sauce), a handful of blanched, unsalted peanuts, a few sliced scallions, and a bed of the most bland brown rice I have ever encountered. Uncle Ben would've been ashamed if that stuff came out of one of his boxes.\n\nGlaringly, there was NO SAUCE!. None at all.\n\nI've had Kung Pao Chicken in New York City, San Francisco, and even from a hole in the wall in Bethel Park, PA that was much, much better. Never have I had it served in such a bland, skimpy, and overpriced way! The \""lunch-portion\"" cost was $9.95.\n\nAt The New Dumpling House, I could have a delicious lunch, with soup, entree and complimentary hot tea, and I could leave satisfied with just $8 out-of-pocket -- and that includes the tip.\n\nThe service was decent. However, lesson learned. One and done. Never going back to PF Changs.","Although I usually stick to my tried-and-true Chinese spot, the New Dumpling House, I was forced to find a new lunch spot due to renovations. I decided to give the chain PF Chang's Chinese Restaurant a try at the Waterfront, but it turned out to be a disappointing mistake. 

The Wonton soup wasn't too pricey at $2.95 and had an adequate amount of broth and flavor, but the wontons were undercooked and doughy. The chicken chunks were also dry, which was surprising since they were in broth. Overall, the soup was just okay. 

For my entrée, I ordered the lunch portion of Chang's Kung Pao Chicken. However, unlike the delicious dark tangy sauce I was used to at the New Dumpling House, PF Chang's version was bland and lacked any sauce at all.

Comparatively, at the New Dumpling House, I could get a soup, entree, and hot tea all for just $8 with a satisfying meal. While the service at PF Chang's was decent, it wasn't enough to make up for the lackluster food. After this experience, I won't be returning to PF Chang's anytime soon.",0,1,0,1

387,"Let's start this review by saying that when we are at that point, my girlfriend and I will be going to Jos. A. Bank for mine and my groomsman's suits.  Allow me to give you a numbered breakdown of the issues we encountered when renting from Men's Wearhouse to be the groomsmen in our friends wedding.\n\n1- They never contacted us after the fitting after saying there would be a followup call.  The other groomsmen and I had to follow up repeatedly to get an answer as to when our tuxedos would arrive and the staff were very short with our honest questions over the phone.\n2- They sent two of our tuxedos to Homestead when we asked for them to be sent to Ross Park Mall during the fitting.\n3- When one of us called two days prior to the wedding to ask if our tux's had arrived the guy answering the phone said \""Oh... I don't know\"" (insert an awkward, pregnant pause here while waiting for him to say \""Let me check that for you\"") he instead said \""Well, I'm going to hang up now.\""  And he made good on that promise, and hung up.\n4- Despite saying we'd get a call a few weeks ahead of the wedding to be resized in case one of us gained a few lbs over the winter, this call never came so we basically had to hope that everything fit as it needed to.\n5- We were at one point informed that MW had our emails on file and that when our tuxes arrived at the store we would receive an email letting us know.  Not a single groomsman received any such email to that effect.\n6- One of the groomsmen randomly received a black tie while everybody else had white.  Another received no studs.  We discovered this approximately two hours to show-time while relatively far from civilization.\n7- On picking up my tux I informed the associate \""I'll be unable to get to a Men's Wearhouse for a few days after the wedding, is this alright?\"" to which she responded \""Yeah that should be fine\"" so when my girlfriend graciously dropped off my tux for me a few days later and learned of the $100 late fee, I was totally caught off guard.\n8- My girlfriend was also caught totally off guard by the associate at Ross Park Mall who was incredibly rude to her when  he informed her of said late fee.\n9- As the Best Man I was given a coupon card for $50 off my next rental at Men's Wearhouse.  Since I am in another wedding next month with rentals from MW I figured this would be an opportune time to use it.  Imagine my shock while paying for the next weddings rental, when I presented the coupon and was told \""Oh, that isn't for this.  That is intended for YOUR wedding.  Oh and it expires on December 31st of this year.\"" \n10- The groom himself decided to use a coupon to purchase a suit for the wedding and to own, rather than rent a tux for the occasion.  He was ensured by the Homestead staff that the coupon would be fine for this purpose and got fitted for it.  When he went to pick up his suit and pay with the aid of said approved coupon he was instead forced into an argument with an associate who insisted he could not use the coupon towards the suit that an associate a few weeks earlier had insisted he could use.  Granted, now I am speaking for another person so take that with as much salt as you may, but he reiterated this fact to me several times prior to his wedding last week.\n\nOver my friends wedding weekend, any time anything even went slightly wrong at and around his wedding, the joke between the Groom and his Groomsmen was \""Effing Men's Wearhouse.\""  For example, at a restaurant, \""Wait I asked for no onions on this sandwich. - Effing Men's Wearhouse!\""  \""Noise complaint at the hotel room? Men's Wearhouse.\""\n\nAnother groomsman looked at me when we discovered the wrong color tie one of us received and said to me \""I hope you're taking notes for your own impending wedding\"" to which I replied \""Perhaps I could find better service from GoodWill of Western PA\""\n\nCongrats Men's Wearhouse.

It seems we are not acknowledged for several minutes, and then the service is mediocre at best.  Occasionally, we've had a stellar service, but it's few and far between.  Today, after waiting 15 minutes, then getting up to find a server in another section, we were informed that we were sitting in a \""closed\"" section.  That server offered to serve us, but honestly, we left.  I told the hostess who seated us about the mixup, and got a blank stare.  I've never had this issue at any other EnP.  We left, drove to the Squirrel Hill location, and our orders were taken in the amount of time we wasted at the Waterfront.  Mgmt- you have a beautiful, prime location.  Get your hosts and servers on the same page!","Although Eat n Park is generally a decent restaurant, this particular branch is infamous for its discouragingly slow service. Regrettably, it's not an isolated incident, as even after numerous visits, we have never waited less than 10 minutes for a server to attend to us. Regardless of the time of day, it seems that we are left unattended for several minutes on end, and then we receive mediocre service at best. Despite a few notable exceptions, it's certainly not worth the trip. On one occasion, we even discovered that we had been seated in a closed section of the restaurant. Although a server from another section offered to attend to us, we eventually decided to leave in frustration. I mentioned the mix-up to the hostess, but received no helpful response. Fortunately, we were welcomed and well-cared-for during our visit to the Squirrel Hill location. Dear management, you have a conveniently located and visually stunning establishment. Please make sure that your servers and hostesses are working together in harmony.",1,1,0,1

While we where in there my friend got hit on by 2 girls and they gave him there numbers while the other young guy across the table yeld dont do it dont do it.

However, we decided to grab a bite instead and it turned out to be a perilous experience. We found ourselves surrounded by rowdy people, including a couple of teenagers who boasted about having been in jail twice. Some were even selling food outside of the establishment we entered. We hastily retreated to our cars and locked the doors, but not before my friend got hit on by two girls who gave him their numbers. Needless to say, we learned our lesson and advise everyone to steer clear of that area unless they enjoy the rough lifestyle.",1,1,0,1

435,"This is the best experience I've had at a bike store in the Pittsburgh area.  I have been shopping around for a couple months for a new road bike (which was going to be my first road bike ever, meaning that I'm fairly clueless about how to pick one out).  Also, since I'm a student, I don't have particularly deep pockets.\n\nAt Big Bang, I was greeted basically the moment I walked in the door.  I'm kind of shy when I know that I don't really know what I'm doing, but I wasn't pressured or harassed in any way by the staff.  Even though my price range was pretty low, they still tried their hardest to find a bike that suited my needs, and they found a bike that fitted me perfectly (and gave me an *excellent* deal on the price).  They take a lot of care to make sure you're properly fitted to the bike.\n\nAlso, this is one of the few bike stores I've been to where test riding is gleefully encouraged, rather than grudgingly allowed.  Definitely it's the only bike store where they'll tell you \""You haven't tried it out enough, go climb up the hill on  it!\"" -- they definitely put the emphasis on matching rider with bike, rather than making a quick sale.\n\nI would definitely recommend this place to anyone who's looking for a road bike, whether they're a seasoned racer or a neophyte rider like me.","Big Bang is by far the best bike store I've visited in the Pittsburgh area. I had been searching for the perfect road bike for months, and since I was new to this, it was a daunting task. Being a student, I was also on a tight budget.

They went out of their way to find me a bike that was within my price range and suited my needs. They made sure that the bike fit me perfectly and gave me an unbelievable deal. Unlike other stores, they encouraged test riding, and I had a blast trying out my new bike. Their aim was not to make a quick sale, but to ensure that the rider and the bike were perfectly matched.

437,"When I think BBB... I think the days of simply bringing your bike in for a quick and relatively inexpensive tune-up and a few fixes are long gone.    \n\nThis review is more for the repair end of BBB. In their defense BBB does appear to carry some amazing brands of bike (ie Colnago) that you just don't find anywhere else in Pittsburgh. \n\nAt BBB I was charged $250 for a tune up and a few other things. Granted this included installing a sew up tire (which I can understand would cost approx $50), Swapping out a left side (big ring) shifter on my down tube (this should have cost approx. $20 at most) and installing new bar tape (cost of tape $20 and $20 to install?).. SO WHAT\""S WITH $140 FOR A TUNE UP? Well the story goes like this:\n\nI bring the bike into BBB prior to the nice weather hitting Pittsburgh in hopes of trying what people have said is a great bike shop and getting my OCLV TREK 5900 ready for the season. Turns out I don't hear from these guys. A week goes by ...two weeks...I think that's ok I have two or three other bike I can turn to for a ride. Then I wind up going out of town for a week thinking for sure I'll get a call from them re: my bike is ready to roll...but no dice. So I call. Turns out a screw snapped when the mechanic was re-installing the down tube shifter and it had to be tapped out (is that my fault?). He says \""Should be ready in a few days\"". So I come in a few days later to this mammoth bill. I ask if I am paying for the labor of taping out the screw? I don't think I ever got a straight answer? I look at the bill and can't see a good breakdown of the charges. Normally I would \""duke it over\"" a bill like this but I figured...I had somewhere I to be 10 minutes ago and at least I finally have my bike. I would expect that for that money my bike could have been stripped down to the frame and totally gone over (overhauled). But it wasn't.  Well BBB I'll give you a star because the mechanic did do a good job in that my cycle shifts well and the tape job on the bars looks great (nice wrap). Plus I'll toss in a star for your outstanding selection of high end cycles. Maybe I would have rated BBB higher if I was in the market for a purchase instead of a simple repair?","The days of getting your bike fixed at a reasonable price are long gone at BBB. However, they do have a great selection of high-end bikes that you can't find anywhere else in the area. During my visit, I paid $250 for a tune-up and some minor repairs, including the installation of a sew-up tire and new bar tape. When I asked about the breakdown of charges, I didn't get a straight answer. Despite the lack of transparency, the mechanic did a good job, and my bike shifts well. Overall, BBB gets a decent rating from me, but I would have preferred a better breakdown of charges and more thorough service for the price.",1,1,0,1

Oh, but when I go home to Pittsburgh, I can have as much of the chewy, flavorful, buttery goodness as I desire from Pierogies Plus.\n\nThe place still looks like an old service station with a tiny building and a roof over an old gas pump island. Inside, though, magical elves... uh... I mean fabulous Polish women... create deliciousness with love -- and butter. Have I mentioned that butter is a part of the deal? Because it totally is. You really should fast for two days before picking up pierogi from here.\n\nOh, but you'll be happy you did. I'm vegetarian, so I only order meat-free pierogi. I'm in love with the saurkraut and the cheese varieties. When you pick up a hot order, you'll get your pierogi covered in with rich butter and sauteed onions. No, I'm serious -- the pierogi are SWIMMING in butter. It's the best thing ever. Everything is packed inside a styrofoam container and a plastic bag, because butter WILL spill out.\n\nYou also can order cold or frozen pierogi if you plan to, say, lug them to the middle of the country to enjoy in a far-off city.\n\nBesides many varieties of pierogi, you also can get things from the deli cases. Last time, I had some apricot blintzes, a latke and some type of apple turnover thingy. I really hope Pierogies Plus has the blintzes when I visit next.\n\nAwesome thing: Pierogies Plus usually has coupons in the Entertainment Book. My best friend and I steal all of the coupons from our families so that I can get a steady stream of discounted Polish goodness each time I visit.\n\nThe only downside is that Pierogies Plus often closes for several days around holidays. I totally understand it -- family time is important! -- but that often coincides with my visits (I head east around the holidays mainly because I get an extra day with the fam without having to take another vacation day). I've learned to plan my trips around the Pierogies Plus schedule, though, because I MUST have yummy goodness. A pierogi-less Allison is a cranky Allison.","Craving delicious pierogi with a buttery taste? Then make your way to Pierogies Plus. Although it may be tough to find good pierogi outside of Pittsburgh, Pierogies Plus offers an abundance of chewy, buttery and tasty options. Housed in a small building resembling an old service station, their fabulous Polish women create magic in every pierogi they make. You won't be disappointed with their vegetarian options, such as the saurkraut and cheese varieties, which come slathered in butter and sauteed onions.

You can even take these amazing pierogi with you wherever you go, since they offer cold and frozen options. And if you're feeling hungry, the deli cases offer other tasty treats such as blintzes, latkes, and apple turnover thingies.

Any place that has Mancini's Italian toast already gets thumbs up in my book.  Being in McKees Rocks, though, they really don't have a choice.  The potatoes were thin sliced with onions and very flavorful.  The only way I can think of to describe the bacon is...porkier.  Is that even a word?  I just don't know how else to descibe it.

463,"I stopped by here this past Tuesday in order to pick up a to go pizza.  My fiance, a friend and I were trying pizza from three different places and Luigi's was one of them.  I have driven by Luigi's many times before and for some reason had never stopped in but that did allow it to come to mind whenever I was looking for a pizza place I had not yet tried in the Bellevue area.  Whenever I called to place my order I was told that my pizza would be ready in about 15 minutes.  I arrived closer to 30 minutes later and was immediately confused whenever I walked into the restaurant.  You see there was a large dining room on the left that was full of people and I didn't immediately see the are where I would get my pizza from.  Finally after a few steps into the restaurant I noticed that the whole back area of the restaurant was where I needed to be and I made my way back there.  My pizza was ready for me and I quickly paid and was leaving whenever the cashier told me \""Stay out of trouble\"".  I really hope that was a friendly sentiment and not one that was based upon my appearance or anything else.  The pizza itself had a medium thick crust with a bland sauce which is weird since I could see a ton of green herbs in it.  The cheese was just ok and nothing special while the pizza itself had a slightly sour taste to it which I did not enjoy.  Out of the three different pizzas we ate that night this one was overwhelmingly our least favorite which was evidenced by the fact that 3/4 of it was left after the evening.\n\nThe bottom line for me is that I will probably not head back to Luigi's in the future.  I just don't see myself making a trip to Luigi's between the weird experience (although not bad) that I had in the restaurant and the fact that there are much better pizza places nearby.","On Tuesday, I decided to try pizza from Luigi's. Although I had driven by many times, I had never tried it before. I called to place my order, and was told it would be ready in 15 minutes.

465,"Recently I've found myself patronizing Bellevue a little more, namely because I've bought a house in the area, and have been checking out some of the mom and pops along the little strip of Mayberry RFD that is the quaint main street. Luigi's is one of those little mom and pops that offers standard basic Italian in a comfortable setting. It's a little kitchy, red-white-and-green, with Dino and Frankie tunes playing in the background.\n\nI've stopped in on several occasions now for dinner, with various friends, and the food has been consistent...it's good...satisfying. Not over-the-top gourmet, or even in the remotest sense 'pretentious'. It's just a good ol' night out for some pasta or lasagna, with a side salad, garlic bread and conversation with your pals.\n\nThe portions are ample, the prices are reasonable, the flavors won't knock your socks off and make you think you've died and gone to Sicily, but they won't make you cringe at having given your money to a profiteering Chef Boyardee either. The service is decent, kind of point blank, not rude, nor over the top friendly. \n\nThe crowd can fluctuate between 'Oh my god, I'm surrounded by Hillbillies' to 'the local gathering at Mayberry', but that seems to be the norm for most places in da burgh.\n\nI've not had the pizza, which apparently get raves, because frankly I only think of pizza as coming in a box to my front door when I'm too lazy to do any cooking at home. But I've had three or four of the pasta dishes, and they come in a generous portion, with a side salad and an order of garlic toast. They taste fine, fill you up, and don't break your bank.\n\nAnd for a local neighborhood joint, that's exactly what I'd hope for. A place you can go to find a dependable and reasonable meal, on a semi-regular basis, in a comfortable setting, with no frills or pretense. \n\nAnd that is exactly what Luigi's is.","Since purchasing a house in the area, I've been frequenting Bellevue more often and checking out the small, locally-owned businesses that line the charming main street. Luigi's is one of those adorable mom-and-pop restaurants that serves simple Italian dishes in a cozy atmosphere. The decor is a bit kitschy, with red, white, and green accents and classic Italian tunes playing in the background.

I've visited Luigi's a few times now with friends and have always found the food to be consistently good and satisfying. It's not gourmet cuisine by any means, but it's not trying to be - it's just a great spot to grab some pasta, lasagna, a side salad, and garlic bread while catching up with friends.

The portions are generous, the prices are reasonable, and the flavors are decent without being too overpowering. The service is fine (not overly friendly, but not rude either) and the atmosphere ranges from casual to the local regulars.

While I haven't tried Luigi's pizza (as I tend to order pizza for delivery at home), I've thoroughly enjoyed their pasta dishes. They always come with a sizable salad and a side of garlic toast, which makes for a filling and affordable meal.

In short, Luigi's is the perfect example of a dependable and affordable neighborhood restaurant - no frills or pretense, just good food in a cozy setting.",0,1,0,1

470,"Wow. What a shame. My family just moved to the area and have been sampling the local cuisine. We are a very large family and love foods of all kind. We've eaten Chinese food from a hundred different places in a dozen different cities. Hands down, this was the worst we've ever had. Cold, tough, congealed, and tasteless - that's the only way to describe it. I'll never order from here again. Quite frankly, the fact that I took time away from my kids to type this out should tell you how awful it was. My complaints fell on deaf ears. I guess they were shocked that someone thought that they were serving low grade dog food. I understand that sometimes restaurants crank out bad food. It happens. But when it does, you bend over backwards to make it right. Not at this place. I was told that he would have to speak with the owner in order to help me.

Yeah, I get it. Chinese food tends to be a little salty, but this was unacceptably salty. \nLeftovers... Yes this is also a con because I threw it away. Suffering through it once was enough! \n\nIf you're craving something made fresh that is spicy and sweet, you're not going to find it here. Just very greasy, very salty, poor excuse for Chinese takeout.","Advantages of dining here include receiving a massive serving size in exchange for your money, although the food quality could be improved. They offer frequent discounts on their website for customers to use. On the downside, the employee who answers the phone can be impolite, leading you to feel as if your questions are a hindrance. Additionally, the pork dumplings are only cooked on one side, leading to a raw center, and every dish tasted overly salty. Consequently, there were plenty of leftovers, but they couldn't be enjoyed and were simply thrown away. If you're searching to satisfy your craving for a fresh or sweet and spicy meal, you won't have any luck here because the food is excessively greasy and salted, making it a subpar option for Chinese takeout.",1,1,0,1
472,"We ordered from here because Uncle Chen, our go-to takeout place down the road, was closed. \n\nI ordered the General Tso tofu, a favorite dish of mine, and hubby ordered the beef Mei Fun noodles. We always grab some egg rolls too. The lady on the phone wasn't rude, per se, but she wasn't exactly helpful or answering any of my questions, either (hubby wanted to see about getting a different sauce on his noodles, and I had to ask a few times before she finally answered my question about how large the tofu dish was). I was in a good mood though, so the attitude over the phone didn't bother me. Price was good, typical takeout rates. The good news is that they will allow you to pay with credit cards over the phone, so if you're like me and never carry cash, you can still get delivery. She told me 45 minutes for the food.\n\nThe food arrived in about 20 minutes (we live half a mile away), it was hot and smelled great. Hubby's Mei Fun looked typical, but he was saddened to see that they didn't exchange the white sauce for brown sauce. The beef was pretty mushy, and didn't taste all that great. The veggies were fresh, and pretty crispy even after soaking in sauce. Noodles were alright, nothing to write home about. My General Tso tofu was delicious, and tasted exactly like the dish I was craving. Fried to perfection, perfect-sized pieces of tofu, and a fantastic sauce. The broccoli was fresh and tasted good. This particular dish only came in one size: Enormous. I think hubby and I just ended up sharing my meal, paired with some mediocre egg rolls.\n\nSo, long story short, lady on the phone was a bit irritating, delivery was fast, food was fresh, and, depending on what you order, the food quality ranges from so-so to great.

477,"I was in need of a pedicure before my beach vacation, so I decided to stop in to Star Nails in Bellevue. I've never had a pedicure before, mostly because I'm super-ticklish, but I felt like it was about time.\n\nThe salon looks quite nice inside; wood (well, laminate) floors, clean decor, and four pedicure chairs up on the platform on the right. I didn't have an appointment, and waited about ten minutes on a Wednesday evening.\n\nNancy was my nail technician, and she greeted me warmly and helped me over into the pedicure area. Pro tip: Don't wear a past-knee-length skirt, as it can make straddling the foot bath to get into the chair slightly awkward. Nancy helped me out like a pro and I was all set.\n\nThe pedicure chairs have a massage feature that reminded me of the Migun massage tables. They don't just vibrate; they knead. The controller is right next to you, so you can stop and start as you like. I just made sure the thing kept running the whole time. The foot bath was nice and warm. I'd brought a book to keep myself busy but turns out all my attention was occupied by relaxing.\n\nNancy guided me through the steps and the slight language barrier isn't much of a problem. She completely understood that I was super-ticklish from the flinching involved, and somehow managed to be very careful about it. It wasn't at all unpleasant, which is what I'd kind of expected.\n\nThis is the awful TMI section, so avert your ayes if you are at all sensitive. Since I've never had a pedicure and I tend to walk around either barefoot or in thin-soled shoes, I had quite a lot of callus built up. The removal was kind of disgusting, so I just didn't look, but it didn't hurt at all. I also tend to ingrown toenails on both big toes, and she dealt with them gently and quickly. I was a bit concerned about having that done at a salon, but it's a week later and my toes haven't turned gangrene, so all's well that ends well.\nEND TMI\n\nEven though it wasn't the spa pedicure (not sure what else THAT involves), I got a full foot and calf massage. Polish on and all done! At which point I thought I might as well get a manicure, too.\n\nThe manicure involved heated mitts and a hand massage, and was very nice. Total cost was $37 plus tip (I gave her $10 for having to deal with my nasty feet). I had some fun conversations with other patrons, and overall a great experience. I'd go back once a day if it were in any way reasonable to do so, but this is getting placed on the once-a-month schedule for sure.\n\nThe polish from the pedicure is still holding up like a champ after a week. The manicure was pretty well shot after a couple of days, so I'll probably just stick with doing the polish at home, although I can't complain about the massage and cuticle care.\n\nAgain, I don't have other salons or spas to compare with, but it seemed like a good, basic service with a few little extras. The staff were all friendly and remembered the repeat customers who came in. They do take credit cards, and you can put the tip on the card as well; I brought cash for that as I am not used to salons taking tips on cards.\n\nThey also offer acrylics (which I don't do), gel nails (which I'd like to try), and nail art.

One stylist told the client whose hair she was cutting that she was going to do something other than what they discussed because it \""wasn't looking right.\""  Ummm, okay.  The other stylist was too busy checking her phone every three seconds to notice she was yanking on her client's hair so hard with the comb that she was giving her poor client whiplash.\n\nAt that point, I just pretended like I had received an urgent text and said, \""I have to leave, so sorry \""as I bolted for the door.","I'm quite particular about my hair but after observing the stylists at Mane Attractions work on other clients for just 15 minutes, I decided to leave. I needed a major haircut and reshaping of my layers but the girl at the counter said my hair might be challenging to work with and I might have to stand during the haircut. They also had no knowledge of hair donation to Locks of Love, which I found disappointing. Despite this, I decided to go ahead with the cut. However, while waiting for my turn, I witnessed the stylists' unprofessional behavior. One stylist changed the agreed-upon hairstyle midway through the cut while the other stylist was constantly checking her phone and roughing up her client's hair. At this point, I made an excuse to leave and made a quick exit.",0,1,0,1
485,"Let me just tell you, I have really, really difficult hair.  type 3b Naturally curly, 100% grey, I dye it dark and mess with the color myself. ( never good)  If you want to know where to get a good haircut you ask someone with my hair. Since I have been going to Mane Attractions I have really LOVED my hair. I have been going there for about 4 years. Kristi was even able to cut my curly hair into a short reverse bob without making me look like i was wearing a helmet. ( you curly girls know what I am talking about). I have had nothing but complements on my hair and even my mom( who is always honest) is impressed. The only complaint I ever have is that yes, sometimes I have gone there on the spur of the moment and it has been closed during the week. I just know to call and schedule things. it is a small business and I get it.  P.S. kids haircuts are only 10$ and My daughter loves it.","As someone with naturally curly, grey hair that I dye myself, finding a good haircut can be a real challenge. But ever since I started going to Mane Attractions four years ago, I've been thrilled with the results. Kristi is a pro at shaping my curls into a flattering, short bob that doesn't leave me looking like I'm wearing a helmet. The compliments keep coming, even from my brutally honest mom. The only downside is that the salon is sometimes closed during the week, so I've learned to call ahead and schedule appointments. Bonus: Mane Attractions also gives incredibly affordable haircuts to kids - my daughter is a huge fan.",1,1,0,1

487,"Lincoln Bakery is yet another local bakery I've been meaning to try.  When a Google Offer came up, I took it so I would have no excuse to keep avoiding it.  The place has a nice neighborhood bakery feel; as I took in the many selections it seemed that everyone who came in was a regular.  There weren't many people when I was there (it was still relatively early) but I got the impression that at times there can be a line to the door.  \nOne thing that I didn't like was although they had many pastries to choose from, nothing was labeled.  So I had to keep asking what things were.  The cinnamon roll was okay, nothing spectacular.  But the pastries I got were very good.  I'd recommend checking it out.  I know if I'm ever in the neighborhood I will stop in for a treat myself.","I had heard about Lincoln Bakery from a friend and had been meaning to visit for some time. When I saw a Google Offer, I decided that it was time to finally try it out. The bakery had a warm and welcoming vibe, and it was clear that many of the customers were regulars. While I was there early and didn't experience any long lines, it seemed as though the bakery could get quite busy. Although the bakery offered a variety of pastries, none of them were labeled, making it difficult to know what was what. However, the treats I tried were delicious, and I would definitely recommend giving Lincoln Bakery a try. If I'm ever in the area again, I plan on stopping by for another treat.",0,1,0,1

Still, this should be a go to for a local bakery if you are looking for something sweet.","Although Lincoln Bakery's donuts, pastries, and desserts are incredibly tasty, we found their selection of bread to be lacking and the quality of what we did select was only average.

492,"So I came to this Red White and Blue with high hopes of thrift store mecca, and I will get to how I left empty handed and in tears.  First, I'll walk you through my experience. \n This place is pretty large, and relatively clean, with a nice parking lot.  The racks are packed with clothes - and I mean, hard to move the hangers because there is so much stock, which can be a pro or a con depending on how you like it.  I found it a bit cumbersome since although the clothes are organized by type (dress vs. blouse) there is NO size separation.  In a place this huge, it takes quite a long time to find what you're looking for without the size separation.  But, I'm not one to abandon a bargain because I don't want to look around (after all, that is what its all about), so I gave a good 30 min-45 and got a handful of garments to try on.  (I would typically spend a few hours, but I was trying to spare a friend not as keen on secondhand garments).  With my carefully extracted finds I searched in vain for a fitting room, never to find one.  After asking the staff where it was, I had to take a seat and leave my jaw dropped for a while because THERE IS NO FITTING ROOM! \nI couldn't take this fact into my brain, and although there were some household items I wanted to go back and buy, I was too upset to continue.  (Sidenote: yes, I can understand how this can work for the RWB, but imho it is unforgivable, and I wish there was at least some warning before spending my time searching for a bargain when I couldn't even see if it would fit). \n\nI would recommend this store if you are looking for something specific secondhand especially for dishes, or older electronics, or even beauty products.  There was even a used Nikon SLR with a wide angle lens ($200 though)!  \nBut if you plan on buying a sundress, and don't plan on stripping down in front of your fellow thrifties, you'd better be confident in your purchase.  RWB is just like any other thrift store, and you can't return or exchange your items, so you'd be out of luck and out of money.","I had high expectations for Red White and Blue thrift store, but unfortunately, I left empty-handed and disappointed. The store is spacious and well-maintained, but the sheer amount of clothing made it difficult to find what I was looking for without size separation. Despite the frustration, I persevered and managed to find a handful of items to try on, only to discover that there were no fitting rooms available. This made it impossible for me to determine if my selections were suitable, and I left feeling frustrated and deflated. While Red White and Blue is a great place to find secondhand household items, electronics, and beauty products, I cannot recommend it for clothes shopping unless you are comfortable buying items without trying them on first.",0,1,0,1

I have been doing this for more years that I haven't been, and it is the best in the city.\n\nI would make a weekly trek to RWB, and would never be disappointed.  These were the days when you could find a vintage 50s something or other on the racks, before there was a \""Vintage\"" section.

494,"I came here all the time while I was freelancing and in charge of my own schedule.  It has a lot of points going for it that other thrift shops consistently mess up.\n\n1. It's well lit.  You can SEE the clothing, see whatever might be wrong with it, and make an honest assessment.  You're never surprised when you leave at the state of the items you've just bought.\n\n2. It is surprisingly clean.  Nothing seems to smell, so I can only imagine they've laundered everything thoroughly. \n\n3. There are good quality brands--Ann Taylor, Kenneth Cole, etc.  It's mainly items along these lines.  You're more likely to find twinsets than clubbing tops here, which if you're over the age of 21 is a good thing.\n\n4. Markdowns and fresh merchandise.  These people *know* how to turn over their stock.  Because the place is never empty, and there are specials every day, the stock flips rapidly.  The merchandise is never the same week to week, so as I mentioned before, it's addictive.  You never know what you'll find.\n\nA summary of a few things I've bought here: a 6 dollar designer knit dress, a few silk twinsets ($2-$5), countless heels, two pairs of Birkenstocks and two pairs of Doc Martens ($4-$8), a dressmaker's bust ($5), a pressure cooker ($7)....\n\nYou get the picture.  The prices aren't rock bottom, but close enough, and the quality of the clothing will help anyone but the stingiest person get over the 50 cents extra.\n\nCan't recommend it enough!","I used to frequent this thrift shop when I was working as a freelancer and could manage my own time. What makes it stand out is that it avoids many of the mistakes other such shops make. Firstly, it's really well-lit, which means you can clearly see the clothes and assess their condition before buying. Secondly, it's surprisingly clean - nothing has that musty smell you often find elsewhere. Thirdly, the shop stocks good quality brands like Ann Taylor and Kenneth Cole, which is great if you're looking for classic rather than flashy styles. Finally, they're always updating their merchandise with fresh stock and markdowns, so there's always something new to discover. I've found some amazing bargains here - designer dresses for $6, silk twinsets for $2-$5, and even Birkenstocks and Doc Martens for $4-$8. Although the prices aren't rock-bottom, the quality more than justifies the extra costs. I can't recommend this shop enough!",1,1,0,1
